## Technical Meetings
The Bioinformatics Support Unit runs a technical meeting series, with talks on Tuesdays at 11am. Most weeks, the talk is given by a <a href='/staff'>member of the BSU</a>, but we are always open to guest contributions from other researchers. 

The talks are intended to be technical in nature, and so it is likely that the meeting series will be of most interest to practising bioinformaticians and computational biologists.

## Drop-in Sessions

We plan to hold drop-in sessions throughout the coming year, these sessions are for any researcher interested in finding out about opportunities for collaborative activity and involving bioinformatics solutions in new investigations.
 
It is also an opportunity to meet the Bioinformatics Support Unit staff who know a lot about informatics tools and their use as part of research project activity.
