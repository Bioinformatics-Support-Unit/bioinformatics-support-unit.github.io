title: "Graham Smith"
---
Graham obtained his first degree and PhD in physics. He then did post-doctoral work at Oxford on modelling permeation in ion channels using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and at Cancer Research UK in London on the computational prediction of the structure of protein-protein complexes using MD and rigid-body docking. He moved to Newcastle in 2005 to work at the Bii, a project of ONE NorthEast, then joined Newcastle University as a research associate in 2008, since when he has worked on a variety of problems in modelling and bioinformatics. These have included modelling signalling pathways related to ageing, particularly the insulin signalling pathway and its interaction with oxidative stress and the FOXO transcription factor. He has also applied a differential equation model of the circulatory system to the investigation of orthostatic symptoms in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, and analysed timecourse transcriptomics data in MSC differentiation as part of a CIMA project in musculoskeletal ageing. He joined the BSU in February 2014 to apply his range of skills to assist in bioinformatics, data analysis, modelling and teaching in the ICM.
