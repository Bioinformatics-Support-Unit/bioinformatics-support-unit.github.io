Jannetta has done many things in her life. She started with a BA in African languages and Sociology and then a postgraduate teaching diploma with the Northwest University in South Africa (in those days it was known as Potchefstroom University).  After uni she did two years in the military, two years teaching and then moved into software development for the next 27 years. Trying to  extend herself academically, she first completed a Diploma in Data Metrics (1995) with the University of South Africa (UNISA) and then an MSc in Computing for Commerce and Industry  (with research in software engineering) with the Open University UK (2009).  Although  her main activity over the years was software development, she was distracted by a few other interesting activities such as first aid instructing, scuba instructing, being a fireman, paramedic, an oyster picker, and text book writing.

Trying to find new ways of making software engineering interesting she managed to get a BBSRC scholarship to do an MSc in Bioinformatic and Computational System Biology at Newcastle University (2010) which she passed with distinction. After the MSc she was offered a scholarship by the school of Computing Science to do a PhD in Computational Neuroscience, investigating the effect of dopamine on the pyloric constrictor neuron complex in the stomatogastric ganglion of the crab, and creating a biologically accurate computational model thereof.

In January 2015, while working toward finishing her PhD, Jannetta joined the BSU to assist the Institute of Genetic Medicine in bioinformatics.
