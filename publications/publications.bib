	abstract = {We previously identified the ZTRE (zinc transcriptional regulatory element) in genes involved in zinc homeostasis and showed that it mediates transcriptional repression in response to zinc. We now report that ZNF658 acts at the ZTRE. ZNF658 was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry of a band excised after electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a ZTRE probe. The protein contains a KRAB domain and 21 zinc fingers. It has similarity with ZAP1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which regulates the response to zinc restriction, including a conserved DNA binding region we show to be functional also in ZNF658. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted to ZNF658 abrogated the zinc-induced, ZTRE-dependent reduction in SLC30A5 (ZnT5 gene), SLC30A10 (ZnT10 gene), and CBWD transcripts in human Caco-2 cells and the ability of zinc to repress reporter gene expression from corresponding promoter-reporter constructs. Microarray analysis of the effect of reducing ZNF658 expression by siRNA uncovered a large decrease in rRNA. We find that ZTREs are clustered within the 45S rRNA precursor. We also saw effects on expression of multiple ribosomal proteins. ZNF658 thus links zinc homeostasis with ribosome biogenesis, the most active transcriptional, and hence zinc-demanding, process in the cell. ZNF658 is thus a novel transcriptional regulator that plays a fundamental role in the orchestrated cellular response to zinc availability.},

	abstract = {Author Summary Although the classical NF-κB pathway is frequently associated with the induction of cellular senescence and the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP), the role of the alternative NF-κB pathway, which is frequently activated in hematological malignancies as well as some solid tumors, has not been defined. We therefore investigated the role of the alternative NF-κB pathway in this process. Here we report that NF-κB2 and RelB, the effectors of the alternative NF-κB pathway, suppress senescence through inhibition of p53 activity. Using primary human fibroblasts, we demonstrate that this is accomplished through NF-κB2/RelB dependent control of a previously unknown pathway, incorporating regulation of CDK4 and 6 expression as well as regulators of p21WAF1 and p53 protein stability. Loss of NF-κB2/RelB results in suppression of retinoblastoma (Rb) tumour suppressor phosphorylation, which in turn leads to inhibition of EZH2 expression and de-repression of p53 activity. Interestingly, we find that CD40 ligand stimulation of cells from Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia patients, which strongly induces the alternative NF-κB pathway, also induces EZH2 expression. We propose that the alternative NF-κB pathway can promote tumorigenesis through suppression of p53 dependent senescence, a process that may have relevance to cancer cells retaining wild type p53.},

	abstract = {AR42J-B-13 (B-13) cells form hepatocyte-like (B-13/H) cells in response to glucocorticoid treatment. To establish its utility in toxicity and genotoxicity screening, cytochrome P450 (CYP) induction, susceptibility to toxins, and transporter gene expression were examined. Conversion to B-13/H cells resulted in expression of male-specific CYP2C11 and sensitivity to methapyrilene. B-13/H cells constitutively expressed CYP1A, induced expression in response to an aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist, and activated benzo[α]pyrene to a DNA-damaging species. Functional CYP1A2 was not expressed due to deletions in the Cyp1a2 gene. A B-13 cell line stably expressing the human CYP1A2 was therefore engineered (B-13−TR/h1A2) and the derived B-13/H cells expressed metabolically functional CYP1A2. Treatment with the cooked food mutagen 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo(4,5-b)pyridine resulted in a dose-dependent increase in DNA damage. B-13/H cells expressed constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and induced CYP2B1 mRNA levels in response to classical CAR activators. However, translation to functional CYP2B1 protein was low and increased minimally by CAR activator treatment. B-13/H cells expressed high levels of pregnane X-receptor (PXR) and induced CYP3A1 in response to classical PXR activators. CYP3A genes were inducible, functional, and activated aflatoxin B1 to a DNA-damaging species. All 23 major hepatic transporters were induced when B-13 cells were converted to B-13/H cells, although in many cases, levels remained below those present in adult rat liver. However, bile salt export pump, Abcb1b, multidrug resistance-associated protein, and breast cancer resistance protein transporters were functional in B-13/H cells. These data demonstrate that the B-13 cell generates hepatocyte-like cells with functional drug metabolism and transporter activities, which can alone—or in a humanized form—be used to screen for hepatotoxic and genotoxic endpoints in vitro.},

	abstract = {Background Mitochondrial disease is a clinically heterogeneous debilitating condition with a minimum birth prevalence of 9.2 per 100,000, and is associated with a reduced life expectancy. The variable clinical phenotype has previously hindered systematic studies making natural history studies largely anecdotal. There is currently no evidence–based treatment for mitochondrial disease.
Objectives To develop a cohort of 1000 people from across the UK with biochemically, and/or genetically, confirmed mitochondrial disease to facilitate large–scale interventional trials of drugs and novel treatments, and to assess prevention strategies. The cohort will also allow definitive studies on the transmission of mtDNA mutations, and provide longitudinal data on the natural history of the disease.
Design \& Methods Following consultation with the clinical research leads, the Bioinformatics Department at Newcastle University designed and accommodated a secure database on a stand–alone dedicated server. The database is backed–up daily to a second identical, but independent server. A data custodian was appointed to oversee the maintenance, security and access to stored patient information. Research associates were employed in Newcastle and London, along with administrative support, to identify and recruit patients to the cohort study. NIHR portfolio adoption facilitated recruitment through local principal investigators at an additional 16 sites across the UK. The British Neurology Surveillance Unit and British Paediatric Neurology Surveillance Unit have been utilised to identify patients not under active follow–up at one of the three centres (Newcastle, London and Oxford) providing the NHS Highly Specialised Service for Rare Mitochondrial Diseases in Adults and Children. Written informed consent is obtained from patients with confirmed mitochondrial disease. Clinical data is recorded retrospectively and prospectively. The Newcastle Mitochondrial Disease Assessment Rating Scale is utilised whenever possible. All patient data is entered anonymously and unique identifiers are used to contact patients suitable for clinical studies.The Mitochondrial Disease Oversight Committee (MDOC), which includes an ethicist and a patient representative, was established to evaluate the scientific merit and appropriateness of applications and govern utilisation of the Cohort.
Results 988 people have been consented to the cohort to date with 120 identified through surveillance units (BNSU/BPNSU); clinical data is available on 935 (95\%). 49\% harbour mtDNA pathogenic mutations, 10\% nDNA mutations, and 41\% have confirmed biochemical defects but no genetic aetiology identified to date. The m.3243A{\textgreater}G mtDNA mutation is the most commonly identified genetic mutation in the cohort (22\%), followed by single mtDNA deletions (12\%), PEO1 (4\%), m.8344A{\textgreater}G (3\%), and common POLG mutations (3\%). At present 8\% are clinically asymptomatic, 57\% exhibit neurological features, 32\% have ophthalmological involvement, 21\% have gastrointestinal disturbances, 19\% have haematological anomalies, 17\% have cardiac involvement, 13\% suffer from endocrine dysfunction. The most common neurological features include: weakness (40\%), ataxia (30\%), migraine (19\%), seizures (13\%), pyramidal/extrapyramidal signs (6\%), encephalopathy (5\%), stroke–like episodes (4\%), myoclonus (3\%). 15 clinical studies have been approved by MDOC, involving over 250 patients with mitochondrial disease. 6 clinical guidelines have been produced and are available for download: www.newcastle–mitochondria.com/service/patient–care–guidelines.
Conclusion For the first time in the UK it is possible to access a large cohort of well–characterised patients with mitochondrial disease. The cohort provides objective data on mitochondrial disease progression, in children and adults, allowing evidence–based guidelines to be developed, and prognostic advice to be provided to patients and families. There is a vast amount of data still to be analysed that will provide systematic evidence and allow the development of disease prevention strategies.},

	abstract = {Objective
To define for the first time the transcriptomes of normal and end-stage osteoarthritis (OA) hip cartilage.
Materials and methods
RNA was isolated from cartilage within 2 h of joint replacement surgery. Gene expression was analyzed using Agilent GeneSpring GX 11 following hybridization to Illumina Human HT-12 V3 microarrays. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to validate the expression of six genes identified by microarray as differentially expressed. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) were used to investigate enriched functions or canonical pathways amongst differentially expressed genes respectively.
Results
In total we identified 998 differentially expressed genes (fold change≥±1.5, P-value≤0.01) between neck of femur fracture (NOF) (n=10) and OA hip (n=9) patient cartilage. These differentially expressed genes were enriched within 71 canonical pathways. A comparison between a comparable knee dataset20 only identified 229 genes similarly differentially expressed although remarkably 34 canonical pathways overlapped between experiments.
Conclusions
This study is the first to report a comprehensive gene expression analysis of human hip OA cartilage compared to control (NOF) cartilage at the whole-genome level. Our differential gene expression dataset shows excellent correlation with similar defined studies using comparable tissue but reveals discord between hip and knee OA at the individual gene status but with commonality with regards the molecular pathways involved.},

A genetic variant in the gene encoding the selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) has been reported to influence colorectal cancer risk. In this study GPX4 expression was knocked down by 60\% using RNA silencing and the effects were investigated using an unbiased transcriptomic analysis. Microarray analysis of the total Caco-2 cell transcriptome was carried out using Illumina HumanHT-12v3 beadchips and the data were validated by real-time PCR. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis showed that the major canonical pathways affected by GPX4 knockdown were oxidative phosphorylation, ubiquinone biosynthesis, and mitochondrial dysfunction and the top two toxicological lists were mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Western blotting and real-time PCR confirmed that knockdown affected target genes encoding components of respiratory complexes I, IV, and V as well as the protein apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). GPX4 knockdown increased levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and oxidized lipid and decreased mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate levels and mitochondrial membrane potential. Time-course experiments showed that changes in AIF expression preceded those in the respiratory complexes. We conclude that in Caco-2 gut epithelial cells GPx4, through effects on AIF, plays a major role in maintaining the oxidative phosphorylation system and protecting mitochondria from oxidative damage.},

Methods Total RNA was isolated from highly purified peripheral blood CD4 T cells of 173 early arthritis clinic patients. Paired serum samples were also stored. Microarray analysis of RNA samples was performed and differential transcript expression among 111 ‘training cohort’ patients confirmed using real-time quantitative PCR. Machine learning approaches tested the utility of a classification model among an independent validation cohort presenting with UA (62 patients). Cytokine measurements were performed using a highly sensitive electrochemiluminescence detection system.
Results A 12-gene transcriptional ‘signature’ identified RA patients in the training cohort and predicted the subsequent development of RA among UA patients in the validation cohort (sensitivity 68\%, specificity 70\%). STAT3-inducible genes were over-represented in the signature, particularly in anti-citrullinated peptide antibody-negative disease, providing a risk metric of similar predictive value to the Leiden score in seronegative UA (sensitivity 85\%, specificity 75\%). Baseline levels of serum interleukin 6 (IL-6) (which signals via STAT3) were highest in anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies-negative RA and distinguished this subgroup from non-RA inflammatory synovitis (corrected p{\textless}0.05).Paired serum IL-6 measurements correlated strongly with STAT3-inducible gene expression.
Conclusion The authors have identified IL-6-mediated STAT-3 signalling in CD4 T cells during the earliest clinical phase of RA, which is most prominent in seronegative disease. While highlighting potential biomarker(s) for early RA, the role of this pathway in disease pathogenesis awaits clarification.},

However, due to the overlap between the large number of experiments reported in public databases it is possible to assess the chances of individual observations being correct. In order to do so, existing methods rely on high-quality ‘gold standard’ reference networks, but such reference networks are not always available.
Results: We present a novel algorithm for computing the probability of network interactions that operates without gold standard reference data. We show that our algorithm outperforms existing gold standard-based methods. Finally, we apply the new algorithm to a large collection of genetic interaction and protein–protein interaction experiments.

	abstract = {Background Epigenetic markings acquired in early life may have phenotypic consequences later in development through their role in transcriptional regulation with relevance to the developmental origins of diseases including obesity. The goal of this study was to investigate whether DNA methylation levels at birth are associated with body size later in childhood. Principal Findings A study design involving two birth cohorts was used to conduct transcription profiling followed by DNA methylation analysis in peripheral blood. Gene expression analysis was undertaken in 24 individuals whose biological samples and clinical data were collected at a mean ± standard deviation (SD) age of 12.35 (0.95) years, the upper and lower tertiles of body mass index (BMI) were compared with a mean (SD) BMI difference of 9.86 (2.37) kg/m2. This generated a panel of differentially expressed genes for DNA methylation analysis which was then undertaken in cord blood DNA in 178 individuals with body composition data prospectively collected at a mean (SD) age of 9.83 (0.23) years. Twenty-nine differentially expressed genes ({\textgreater}1.2-fold and p{\textless}10−4) were analysed to determine DNA methylation levels at 1–3 sites per gene. Five genes were unmethylated and DNA methylation in the remaining 24 genes was analysed using linear regression with bootstrapping. Methylation in 9 of the 24 (37.5\%) genes studied was associated with at least one index of body composition (BMI, fat mass, lean mass, height) at age 9 years, although only one of these associations remained after correction for multiple testing (ALPL with height, pCorrected = 0.017). Conclusions DNA methylation patterns in cord blood show some association with altered gene expression, body size and composition in childhood. The observed relationship is correlative and despite suggestion of a mechanistic epigenetic link between in utero life and later phenotype, further investigation is required to establish causality.},

Strategies which assist in the prioritisation of target loci that have the potential to be epigenetically regulated might provide a useful approach in identifying concrete examples of epigenotype–phenotype associations. Focusing on the postulated role of epigenetic factors in the aetiopathogenesis of obesity this report outlines an approach utilising gene expression data and a suite of bioinformatic tools to prioritise a list of target candidate genes for more detailed experimental scrutiny. Gene expression microarrays were performed using peripheral blood RNA from children aged 11–13 years selected from the Newcastle Preterm Birth Growth Study which were grouped by body mass index (BMI). Genes showing ≥ 2.0 fold differential expression between low and high BMI groups were selected for in silico analysis. Several bioinformatic tools were used for each following step; 1) a literature search was carried out to identify whether the differentially expressed genes were associated with adiposity phenotypes. Of those obesity-candidate genes, putative epigenetically regulated promoters were identified by 2) defining the promoter regions, 3) then by selecting promoters with a CpG island (CGI), 4) and then by identifying any transcription factor binding modules covering CpG sites within the CGI. This bioinformatic processing culminated in the identification of a short list of target obesity-candidate genes putatively regulated by DNA methylation which can be taken forward for experimental analysis. The proposed workflow provides a flexible, versatile and low cost methodology for target gene prioritisation that is applicable to multiple species and disease contexts.},

The aim of this study was to establish whether this pathway is mediated by altered DNA methylation and gene expression. Two distinct cohorts, one preterm (n = 121) and one term born (n = 6,990), were studied. Exploratory analyses were performed using microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes in whole blood from children defined as “slow” (n = 10) compared with “rapid” (n = 10) postnatal (term to 12 weeks corrected age) growers. Methylation within the identified TACSTD2 gene was measured in both cohorts, and rs61779296 genotype was determined by Pyrosequencing or imputation and analyzed in relation to body composition at 9–15 years of age. In cohort 1, TACSTD2 expression was inversely correlated with methylation (P = 0.016), and both measures were associated with fat mass (expression, P = 0.049; methylation, P = 0.037). Although associated with gene expression (cohort 1, P = 0.008) and methylation (cohort 1, P = 2.98 × 10−11; cohort 2, P = 3.43 × 10−15), rs61779296 was not associated with postnatal growth or fat mass in either cohort following multiple regression analysis. Hence, the lack of association between fat mass and a methylation proxy SNP suggests that reverse causation or confounding may explain the initial association between fat mass and gene regulation. Noncausal methylation patterns may still be useful predictors of later adiposity.},

	abstract = {Background/Aims To investigate the difference between human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human ocular microvascular endothelial cell (MVEC) gene expression, and to determine if these differences could improve the understanding of ocular angiogenic diseases.
Methods The gene expression profiles of HUVEC and matched unpassaged human choroidal, retinal and iris endothelial cells were conducted using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. Selected differences were confirmed by real time PCR. Functional cell proliferation assays were used to support microarray findings.
Results HUVEC showed enrichment for probe sets involved in embryological development while ocular MVEC demonstrated enrichment for probe sets for MHC classes I and II, immune responses and cell signal transduction. Comparison of human retinal and choroidal endothelial cells demonstrated significant differences in the expression of probe sets encoding insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signalling. Cell proliferation assays demonstrated the stimulatory role of IGF-1 on retinal endothelial cells compared with choroidal endothelial cells.
Conclusions Gene expression profiling has demonstrated that HUVEC are probably not a suitable surrogate for the study of ocular angiogenic disorders. There are also significant differences in the gene expression of human retinal and choroidal endothelial cells, which may be important in the mechanism and treatment of choroidal and retinal neovascularisation.},

The quality of the protein scaffold, by which the binding peptide is constrained and presented, is of crucial importance. SQT (Stefin A Quadruple Mutant—Tracy) is our most recent development in the Stefin A-derived scaffold series. Stefin A naturally uses three surfaces to interact with its targets. SQT tolerates peptide insertions at all three positions. Peptide aptamers in the SQT scaffold can be expressed in bacterial, yeast and human cells, and displayed as a fusion to truncated pIII on phage. Peptides that bind to CDK2 can show improved binding in protein microarrays when presented by the SQT scaffold. Yeast two-hybrid libraries have been screened for binders to the POZ domain of BCL-6 and to a peptide derived from PBP2’, specific to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Presentation of the Noxa BH3 helix by SQT allows specific interaction with Mcl-1 in human cells. Together, our results show that Stefin A-derived scaffolds, including SQT, can be used for a variety of applications in cellular and molecular biology.

These properties facilitate their use as the detector components of biosensor devices. However, the identification of suitable aptamer targets for particular groups of organisms is challenging. We present a semi-automated processing pipeline for the identification of candidate aptamer targets from whole bacterial genome sequences. The pipeline can be configured to search for protein sequence fragments that uniquely identify a set of strains of interest. The system is also capable of identifying additional organisms that may be of interest due to their possession of protein fragments in common with the initial set. Through the use of Cloud computing technology and distributed databases, our system is capable of scaling with the rapidly growing genome repositories, and consequently of keeping the resulting data sets up-to-date. The system described is also more generically applicable to the discovery of specific targets for other diagnostic approaches such as DNA probes, PCR primers and antibodies.},

	abstract = {Most human somatic cells contain no or very low levels of telomerase. The over-expression of the catalytic subunit (hTERT) of human telomerase is a common method to generate cells with a greatly prolonged lifespan. These cells serve as models for cells that are either difficult to cultivate or have a limited lifespan in vitro. In addition, hTERT over-expressing cells are thought to be a useful resource for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. While tumour suppressors and cell cycle checkpoints are maintained for an extended period in most hTERT over-expressing cells we found that there is a gradual change in gene expression over a range of 130 population doublings (PD) for the majority of genes analysed. Seven genes were significantly down-regulated with increasing population doublings (PDs), while only two were up-regulated. One gene, stanniocalcin 2, was highly expressed in parental fibroblasts but completely diminished as a consequence of hTERT transgene expression. These data demonstrate that in hTERT over-expressing cells two different types of expression changes occur: one can be directly associated with hTERT transgene expression itself, while others might occur more gradual and with varying kinetics. These changes should be taken into account when these cells are used as functional models or for regenerative purposes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The skeletal site-specific influence of multiple genes on bone morphology is recognised, but the question as to how these influences may be exerted at the molecular and cellular level has not been explored.
METHODOLOGY: To address this question, we have compared global gene expression profiles of human trabecular bone from two different skeletal sites that experience vastly different degrees of mechanical loading, namely biopsies from iliac crest and lumbar spinal lamina.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the lumbar spine, compared to the iliac crest, the majority of the differentially expressed genes showed significantly increased levels of expression; 3406 transcripts were up- whilst 838 were down-regulated. Interestingly, all gene transcripts that have been recently demonstrated to be markers of osteocyte, as well as osteoblast and osteoclast-related genes, were markedly up-regulated in the spine. The transcriptome data is consistent with osteocyte numbers being almost identical at the two anatomical sites, but suggesting a relatively low osteocyte functional activity in the iliac crest. Similarly, osteoblast and osteoclast expression data suggested similar numbers of the cells, but presented with higher activity in the spine than iliac crest. This analysis has also led to the identification of expression of a number of transcripts, previously known and novel, which to our knowledge have never earlier been associated with bone growth and remodelling.
CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides molecular evidence explaining anatomical and micro-architectural site-related changes in bone cell function, which is predominantly attributable to alteration in cell transcriptional activity. A number of novel signaling molecules in critical pathways, which have been hitherto not known to be expressed in bone cells of mature vertebrates, were identified.},

	abstract = {Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) due to flucloxacillin is a rare but serious complication of treatment. There is some evidence that flucloxacillin is a human pregnane X receptor (PXR) agonist. This study was designed to investigate the relevance of PXR to flucloxacillin toxicity and to identify genes changing in expression in response to flucloxacillin. Changes in gene expression in human hepatocytes after treatment with 500 microM flucloxacillin for 72 hours were examined by expression microarray analysis. The ability of flucloxacillin to act as a PXR agonist was investigated with reporter gene experiments. Flucloxacillin DILI cases (n = 51), drug-exposed controls without toxicity (n = 64), and community controls (n = 90) were genotyped for three common PXR polymorphisms. Luciferase reporter assays were used to assess the significance of a promoter region PXR polymorphism. Seventy-two probe sets representing 50 different genes showed significant changes in expression of 1.2-fold or higher. Most genes showing changes greater than 3-fold were known to be rifampicin-responsive, and this suggested a PXR-dependent mode of regulation. Using a luciferase-everted repeat separated by 6 base pairs element construct, we confirmed that flucloxacillin was a PXR agonist. We found a difference in the distribution of a PXR polymorphism (rs3814055; C-25385T) between flucloxacillin DILI cases and controls with the CC genotype associated with an increased risk of disease (odds ratio = 3.37, 95\% confidence interval = 1.55-7.30, P = 0.0023). Reporter gene experiments showed lower promoter activity for the C allele than the T allele.
CONCLUSION: Flucloxacillin is a PXR agonist at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, and a functionally significant upstream PXR polymorphism is a risk factor for flucloxacillin-induced DILI.},

	abstract = {Information theory, the mathematical theory of communication in the presence of noise, is playing an increasingly important role in modern quantitative neuroscience. It makes it possible to treat neural systems as stochastic communication channels and gain valuable, quantitative insights into their sensory coding function. These techniques provide results on how neurons encode stimuli in a way which is independent of any specific assumptions on which part of the neuronal response is signal and which is noise, and they can be usefully applied even to highly non-linear systems where traditional techniques fail. In this article, we describe our work and experiences using Python for information theoretic analysis. We outline some of the algorithmic, statistical and numerical challenges in the computation of information theoretic quantities from neural data. In particular, we consider the problems arising from limited sampling bias and from calculation of maximum entropy distributions in the presence of constraints representing the effects of different orders of interaction in the system. We explain how and why using Python has allowed us to significantly improve the speed and domain of applicability of the information theoretic algorithms, allowing analysis of data sets characterized by larger numbers of variables. We also discuss how our use of Python is facilitating integration with collaborative databases and centralised computational resources.},

We investigated the bi-directionally transcribed Na/phosphate cotransporter gene (Slc34a1) under the aspect of endo-siRNA processing. Mouse Slc34a1 produces an antisense transcript that represents an alternative splice product of the Pfn3 gene located downstream of Slc34a1. The antisense transcript is prominently found in testis and in kidney. Co-expression of in vitro synthesized sense/antisense transcripts in Xenopus oocytes indicated processing of the overlapping transcripts into endo-siRNAs in the nucleus. Truncation experiments revealed that an overlap of at least 29 base-pairs is required to induce processing. We detected endo-siRNAs in mouse tissues that co express Slc34a1 sense/antisense transcripts by northern blotting. The orientation of endo-siRNAs was tissue specific in mouse kidney and testis. In kidney where the Na/phosphate cotransporter fulfils its physiological function endo-siRNAs complementary to the NAT were detected, in testis both orientations were found. Considering the wide spread expression of NATs and the gene silencing potential of endo-siRNAs we hypothesized a genome-wide link between antisense transcription and monoallelic expression. Significant correlation between random imprinting and antisense transcription could indeed be established. Our findings suggest a novel, more general role for NATs in gene regulation.},

CMC includes patients with AIRE gene mutations who have autoimmune polyendocrinopathy candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy (APECED), and patients without known mutations. CMC patients have dysregulated cytokine production, suggesting that defective expression of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) may underlie disease pathogenesis. In 29 patients with CMC (13 with APECED) and controls, we assessed dendritic cell (DC) subsets and monocyte Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression in blood. We generated and stimulated monocyte-derived (mo)DCs with Candida albicans, TLR-2/6 ligand and lipopolysaccharide and assessed PRR mRNA expression by polymerase chain reaction [TLR-1-10, Dectin-1 and -2, spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and caspase recruitment domain (CARD) 9] in immature and mature moDCs. We demonstrate for the first time that CMC patients, with or without APECED, have normal blood levels of plasmocytoid and myeloid DCs and monocyte TLR-2/TLR-6 expression. We showed that in immature moDCs, expression levels of all PRRs involved in anti-Candida responses (TLR-1, -2, -4, -6, Dectin-1, Syk, CARD9) were comparable to controls, implying that defects in PRR expression are not responsible for the increased susceptibility to Candida infections seen in CMC patients. However, as opposed to healthy controls, both groups of CMC patients failed to down-regulate PRR mRNA expression in response to Candida, consistent with defective DC maturation, as we reported recently. Thus, impaired DC maturation and consequent altered regulation of PRR signalling pathways rather than defects in PRR expression may be responsible for inadequate Candida handling in CMC patients.},

The benefit of the resulting natural antisense transcripts (NATs) remains unclear, largely because of a lack of significant correlation between gene ontology and antisense transcription. Here we suggest that a well defined group of NATs may be identified based on structural characteristics. Specifically, these NATs are processed transcripts that are complementary to the corresponding processed sense transcripts in exonic regions. Recent reports have established that co-expressed sense transcripts/NATs are processed into short RNAs. These so called endo-siRNAs are found in both sense and antisense orientation and were hypothesized to mediate pseudogene silencing. Here we propose that NATs are biologically important sources of endo-siRNAs. We also propose that endo-siRNAs are essential components of a regulatory network to control the mutagenic burden that unfolds on nucleic acid level without direct consequences on protein expression.},

To further the knowledge of gene-regulatory effects of Zn on tissues important for adult and fetal Zn nutrition, we analysed the responses of human intestinal Caco-2 and placental JAR cells to changes in Zn supply. Analysis of oligonucleotide microarrays demonstrated that, despite the analogous roles of the two tissues in nutrient transfer, different genes respond to changes in Zn availability in intestinal cells compared with placental cells. A number of Fe- and Cu-related genes were identified as targets for regulation by Zn, revealing potential mechanisms underlying reported dietary interactions between Zn and other metals. We established that there are fundamental differences in Zn-regulated transcriptional control in Caco-2 compared with JAR cells. We demonstrated that Zn-induced transcriptional activation of the metallothionein 2A promoter occurs over different, and physiologically relevant, concentration ranges in Caco-2 and JAR cells, indicating that these cell lines sense changes in the extracellular Zn concentration over different ranges. Also, we established that mRNA levels of the Zn-responsive metal response element binding transcription factor (MTF)-1, and its homologue MTF-2, are regulated by Zn in Caco-2 but not JAR cells, which may in part underlie differential gene responses to Zn in intestinal and placental cells. The present study identified a number of novel molecular targets that may underlie symptoms associated with deficient or excessive Zn supply and highlighted the necessity of taking account of cell- and tissue-specific processes when investigating Zn-regulated gene expression in mammals.},

	doi = {10.1186/gb-2008-9-10-r146},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telomeres prevent the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes from being recognized as damaged DNA and protect against cancer and ageing. When telomere structure is perturbed, a co-ordinated series of events promote arrest of the cell cycle so that cells carrying damaged telomeres do not divide. In order to better understand the eukaryotic response to telomere damage, budding yeast strains harboring a temperature sensitive allele of an essential telomere capping gene (cdc13-1) were subjected to a transcriptomic study.
RESULTS: The genome-wide response to uncapped telomeres in yeast cdc13-1 strains, which have telomere capping defects at temperatures above approximately 27 degrees C, was determined. Telomere uncapping in cdc13-1 strains is associated with the differential expression of over 600 transcripts. Transcripts affecting responses to DNA damage and diverse environmental stresses were statistically over-represented. BNA2, required for the biosynthesis of NAD+, is highly and significantly up-regulated upon telomere uncapping in cdc13-1 strains. We find that deletion of BNA2 and NPT1, which is also involved in NAD+ synthesis, suppresses the temperature sensitivity of cdc13-1 strains, indicating that NAD+ metabolism may be linked to telomere end protection.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the hypothesis that the response to telomere uncapping is related to, but distinct from, the response to non-telomeric double-strand breaks. The induction of environmental stress responses may be a conserved feature of the eukaryotic response to telomere damage. BNA2, which is involved in NAD+ synthesis, plays previously unidentified roles in the cellular response to telomere uncapping.},

Here we describe a novel method that uses structural models to reduce a large number of in silico predictions to a high confidence subset that is amenable to experimental validation.
RESULTS: A two-stage evaluation procedure was developed, first, a sequence-based method assessed the conservation of protein interface patches used in the original in silico prediction method, both in terms of position within the primary sequence, and in terms of sequence conservation. When applying the most stringent conditions it was found that 20.5\% of the data set being assessed passed this test. Secondly, a high-throughput structure-based docking evaluation procedure assessed the soundness of three dimensional models produced for the putative interactions. Of the data set being assessed, 8264 interactions or over 70\% could be modelled in this way, and 27\% of these can be considered 'valid' by the applied criteria. In all, 6.9\% of the interactions passed both the tests and can be considered to be a high confidence set of predicted interactions, several of which are described.

	doi = {10.1186/s40246-015-0036-0},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: SIRT1 is likely to play a role in the extension in healthspan induced by dietary restriction. Actions of SIRT1 are pleiotropic, and effects on healthspan may include effects on DNA methylation. Polycomb group protein target genes (PCGTs) are suppressed by epigenetic mechanisms in stem cells, partly through the actions of the polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs), and have been shown previously to correspond with loci particularly susceptible to age-related changes in DNA methylation. We hypothesised that SIRT1 would affect DNA methylation particularly at PCGTs. To map the sites in the genome where SIRT1 affects DNA methylation, we altered SIRT1 expression in human intestinal (Caco-2) and vascular endothelial (HuVEC) cells by transient transfection with an expression construct or with siRNA. DNA was enriched for the methylated fraction then sequenced (HuVEC) or hybridised to a human promoter microarray (Caco-2).
RESULTS: The profile of genes where SIRT1 manipulation affected DNA methylation was enriched for PCGTs in both cell lines, thus supporting our hypothesis. SIRT1 knockdown affected the mRNA for none of seven PRC components nor for DNMT1 or DNMT3b. We thus find no evidence that SIRT1 affects DNA methylation at PCGTs by affecting the expression of these gene transcripts. EZH2, a component of PRC2 that can affect DNA methylation through association with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), did not co-immunoprecipitate with SIRT1, and SIRT1 knockdown did not affect the expression of EZH2 protein. Thus, it is unlikely that the effects of SIRT1 on DNA methylation at PCGTs are mediated through direct intermolecular association with EZH2 or through effects in its expression.
CONCLUSIONS: SIRT1 affects DNA methylation across the genome, but particularly at PCGTs. Although the mechanism through which SIRT1 has these effects is yet to be uncovered, this action is likely to contribute to extended healthspan, for example under conditions of dietary restriction.},

We additionally report a previously unappreciated tumour suppressor function for hepatocellular nfkb1 operating via p50:p50 dimers and the co-repressor HDAC1. These anti-inflammatory proteins combine to transcriptionally repress hepatic expression of a S100A8/9, CXCL1 and CXCL2 neutrophil chemokine network. Loss of nfkb1 promotes ageing-associated chronic liver disease (CLD), characterized by steatosis, neutrophillia, fibrosis, hepatocyte telomere damage and HCC. Nfkb1(S340A/S340A)mice carrying a mutation designed to selectively disrupt p50:p50:HDAC1 complexes are more susceptible to HCC; by contrast, mice lacking S100A9 express reduced neutrophil chemokines and are protected from HCC.

	abstract = {Streptococcus gordonii is an oral commensal and an early coloniser of dental plaque. In vitro, S. gordonii is conditionally auxotrophic for arginine in monoculture but biosynthesises arginine when coaggregated with Actinomyces oris. Here, we investigated the arginine-responsive regulatory network of S. gordonii and the basis for conditional arginine auxotrophy. ArcB, the catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase involved in arginine degradation, was also essential for arginine biosynthesis. However, arcB was poorly expressed following arginine depletion, indicating that arcB levels may limit S. gordonii arginine biosynthesis. Arginine metabolism gene expression was tightly co-ordinated by three ArgR/AhrC family regulators, encoded by argR, ahrC and arcR genes. Microarray analysis revealed that {\textgreater} 450 genes were regulated in response to rapid shifts in arginine concentration, including many genes involved in adhesion and biofilm formation. In a microfluidic salivary biofilm model, low concentrations of arginine promoted S. gordonii growth, whereas high concentrations ({\textgreater} 5 mM arginine) resulted in dramatic reductions in biofilm biomass and changes to biofilm architecture. Collectively, these data indicate that arginine metabolism is tightly regulated in S. gordonii and that arginine is critical for gene regulation, cellular growth and biofilm formation. Manipulating exogenous arginine concentrations may be an attractive approach for oral biofilm control.},

	doi = {10.1038/nm.2893},
	abstract = {We investigated whether ancestral liver damage leads to heritable reprogramming of hepatic wound healing in male rats. We found that a history of liver damage corresponds with transmission of an epigenetic suppressive adaptation of the fibrogenic component of wound healing to the male F1 and F2 generations. Underlying this adaptation was less generation of liver myofibroblasts, higher hepatic expression of the antifibrogenic factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) and lower expression of the profibrogenic factor transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) compared to rats without this adaptation. Remodeling of DNA methylation and histone acetylation underpinned these alterations in gene expression. Sperm from rats with liver fibrosis were enriched for the histone variant H2A.Z and trimethylation of histone H3 at Lys27 (H3K27me3) at PPAR-γ chromatin. These modifications to the sperm chromatin were transmittable by adaptive serum transfer from fibrotic rats to naive rats and similar modifications were induced in mesenchymal stem cells exposed to conditioned media from cultured rat or human myofibroblasts. Thus, it is probable that a myofibroblast-secreted soluble factor stimulates heritable epigenetic signatures in sperm so that the resulting offspring better adapt to future fibrogenic hepatic insults. Adding possible relevance to humans, we found that people with mild liver fibrosis have hypomethylation of the PPARG promoter compared to others with severe fibrosis.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2164-11-99},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Trichomonas vaginalis is the most common non-viral human sexually transmitted pathogen and importantly, contributes to facilitating the spread of HIV. Yet very little is known about its surface and secreted proteins mediating interactions with, and permitting the invasion and colonisation of, the host mucosa. Initial annotations of T. vaginalis genome identified a plethora of candidate extracellular proteins.
RESULTS: Data mining of the T. vaginalis genome identified 911 BspA-like entries (TvBspA) sharing TpLRR-like leucine-rich repeats, which represent the largest gene family encoding potential extracellular proteins for the pathogen. A broad range of microorganisms encoding BspA-like proteins was identified and these are mainly known to live on mucosal surfaces, among these T. vaginalis is endowed with the largest gene family. Over 190 TvBspA proteins with inferred transmembrane domains were characterised by a considerable structural diversity between their TpLRR and other types of repetitive sequences and two subfamilies possessed distinct classic sorting signal motifs for endocytosis. One TvBspA subfamily also shared a glycine-rich protein domain with proteins from Clostridium difficile pathogenic strains and C. difficile phages. Consistent with the hypothesis that TvBspA protein structural diversity implies diverse roles, we demonstrated for several TvBspA genes differential expression at the transcript level in different growth conditions. Identified variants of repetitive segments between several TvBspA paralogues and orthologues from two clinical isolates were also consistent with TpLRR and other repetitive sequences to be functionally important. For one TvBspA protein cell surface expression and antibody responses by both female and male T. vaginalis infected patients were also demonstrated.
CONCLUSIONS: The biased mucosal habitat for microbial species encoding BspA-like proteins, the characterisation of a vast structural diversity for the TvBspA proteins, differential expression of a subset of TvBspA genes and the cellular localisation and immunological data for one TvBspA; all point to the importance of the TvBspA proteins to various aspects of T. vaginalis pathobiology at the host-pathogen interface.},

Despite their potential importance for understanding antibiotic resistance and pathogenesis, little is known about their basic cell biology or their means of propagation. We have developed a controllable system for generating L-forms in the highly tractable model bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Here, using genome sequencing, we identify a single point mutation that predisposes cells to grow without a wall. We show that propagation of L-forms does not require the normal FtsZ-dependent division machine but occurs by a remarkable extrusion-resolution mechanism. This novel form of propagation provides insights into how early forms of cellular life may have proliferated.},

	issn = {1471-2164},
	doi = {10.1186/1471-2164-9-458},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The successful interaction of bacterial pathogens with host tissues requires the sensing of specific chemical and physical cues. The human gut contains a huge number of neurons involved in the secretion and sensing of a class of neuroendocrine hormones called catecholamines. Recently, in Escherichia coli O157:H7, the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline were shown to act synergistically with a bacterial quorum sensing molecule, autoinducer 3 (AI-3), to affect bacterial virulence and motility. We wished to investigate the impact of adrenaline on the biology of Salmonella spp.
RESULTS: We have determined the effect of adrenaline on the transcriptome of the gut pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Addition of adrenaline led to an induction of key metal transport systems within 30 minutes of treatment. The oxidative stress responses employing manganese internalisation were also elicited. Cells lacking the key oxidative stress regulator OxyR showed reduced survival in the presence of adrenaline and complete restoration of growth upon addition of manganese. A significant reduction in the expression of the pmrHFIJKLM antimicrobial peptide resistance operon reduced the ability of Salmonella to survive polymyxin B following addition of adrenaline. Notably, both phenotypes were reversed by the addition of the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol. Our data suggest that the BasSR two component signal transduction system is the likely adrenaline sensor mediating the antimicrobial peptide response.
CONCLUSION: Salmonella are able to sense adrenaline and downregulate the antimicrobial peptide resistance pmr locus through the BasSR two component signalling system. Through iron transport, adrenaline may affect the oxidative stress balance of the cell requiring OxyR for normal growth. Both adrenaline effects can be inhibited by the addition of the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol. Adrenaline sensing may provide an environmental cue for the induction of the Salmonella stress response in anticipation of imminent host-derived oxidative stress. However, adrenaline may also serve in favour of the host defences by lowering antimicrobial peptide resistance and hence documenting for the first time such a function for a hormone.},

	abstract = {The origin of the eukaryotic genetic apparatus is thought to be central to understanding the evolution of the eukaryotic cell. Disagreement about the source of the relevant genes has spawned competing hypotheses for the origins of the eukaryote nuclear lineage. The iconic rooted 3-domains tree of life shows eukaryotes and archaebacteria as separate groups that share a common ancestor to the exclusion of eubacteria. By contrast, the eocyte hypothesis has eukaryotes originating within the archaebacteria and sharing a common ancestor with a particular group called the Crenarchaeota or eocytes. Here, we have investigated the relative support for each hypothesis from analysis of 53 genes spanning the 3 domains, including essential components of the eukaryotic nucleic acid replication, transcription, and translation apparatus. As an important component of our analysis, we investigated the fit between model and data with respect to composition. Compositional heterogeneity is a pervasive problem for reconstruction of ancient relationships, which, if ignored, can produce an incorrect tree with strong support. To mitigate its effects, we used phylogenetic models that allow for changing nucleotide or amino acid compositions over the tree and data. Our analyses favor a topology that supports the eocyte hypothesis rather than archaebacterial monophyly and the 3-domains tree of life.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-6-264},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: maxdLoad2 is a relational database schema and Java application for microarray experimental annotation and storage. It is compliant with all standards for microarray meta-data capture; including the specification of what data should be recorded, extensive use of standard ontologies and support for data exchange formats. The output from maxdLoad2 is of a form acceptable for submission to the ArrayExpress microarray repository at the European Bioinformatics Institute. maxdBrowse is a PHP web-application that makes contents of maxdLoad2 databases accessible via web-browser, the command-line and web-service environments. It thus acts as both a dissemination and data-mining tool.
RESULTS: maxdLoad2 presents an easy-to-use interface to an underlying relational database and provides a full complement of facilities for browsing, searching and editing. There is a tree-based visualization of data connectivity and the ability to explore the links between any pair of data elements, irrespective of how many intermediate links lie between them. Its principle novel features are: the flexibility of the meta-data that can be captured, the tools provided for importing data from spreadsheets and other tabular representations, the tools provided for the automatic creation of structured documents, the ability to browse and access the data via web and web-services interfaces. Within maxdLoad2 it is very straightforward to customise the meta-data that is being captured or change the definitions of the meta-data. These meta-data definitions are stored within the database itself allowing client software to connect properly to a modified database without having to be specially configured. The meta-data definitions (configuration file) can also be centralized allowing changes made in response to revisions of standards or terminologies to be propagated to clients without user intervention.maxdBrowse is hosted on a web-server and presents multiple interfaces to the contents of maxd databases. maxdBrowse emulates many of the browse and search features available in the maxdLoad2 application via a web-browser. This allows users who are not familiar with maxdLoad2 to browse and export microarray data from the database for their own analysis. The same browse and search features are also available via command-line and SOAP server interfaces. This both enables scripting of data export for use embedded in data repositories and analysis environments, and allows access to the maxd databases via web-service architectures.
CONCLUSION: maxdLoad2 http://www.bioinf.man.ac.uk/microarray/maxd/ and maxdBrowse http://dbk.ch.umist.ac.uk/maxdBrowse are portable and compatible with all common operating systems and major database servers. They provide a powerful, flexible package for annotation of microarray experiments and a convenient dissemination environment.

	abstract = {Although children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) generally have a good outcome, some patients do relapse and survival following relapse is poor. Altered DNA methylation is highly prevalent in ALL and raises the possibility that DNA methylation-based biomarkers could predict patient outcome. In this study, genome-wide methylation analysis, using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip platform, was carried out on 52 diagnostic patient samples from 4 genetic subtypes [ETV6-RUNX1, high hyperdiploidy (HeH), TCF3-PBX1 and dic(9;20)(p11-13;q11)] in a 1:1 case-control design with patients who went on to relapse (as cases) and patients achieving long-term remission (as controls). Pyrosequencing assays for selected loci were used to confirm the array-generated data. Non-negative matrix factorization consensus clustering readily clustered samples according to genetic subgroups and gene enrichment pathway analysis suggested that this is in part driven by epigenetic disruption of subtype specific signaling pathways. Multiple bioinformatics approaches (including bump hunting and individual locus analysis) were used to identify CpG sites or regions associated with outcome. However, no associations with relapse were identified. Our data revealed that ETV6-RUNX1 and dic(9;20) subtypes were mostly associated with hypermethylation; conversely, TCF3-PBX1 and HeH were associated with hypomethylation. We observed significant enrichment of the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway in TCF3-PBX1 as well as an enrichment of genes involved in immunity and infection pathways in ETV6-RUNX1 subtype. Taken together, our results suggest that altered DNA methylation may have differential impacts in distinct ALL genetic subtypes.},

To identify factors affecting coordination of DNA replication, we have performed genome-wide Quantitative Fitness Analyses (QFA) of budding yeast cells containing defective polymerases. We combined temperature sensitive mutations affecting the three replicative polymerases, Pol α, Pol δ and Pol ε with genome-wide collections of null and reduced function mutations. We identify large numbers of genetic interactions that inform about the roles that specific genes play to help Pol α, Pol δ and Pol ε function. Surprisingly, the overlap between the genetic networks affecting the three DNA polymerases does not represent the majority of the genetic interactions identified. Instead our data support a model for division of labor between the different DNA polymerases during DNA replication. For example, our genetic interaction data are consistent with biochemical data showing that Pol ε is more important to the Pre-Loading complex than either Pol α or Pol δ. We also observed distinct patterns of genetic interactions between leading- and lagging-strand DNA polymerases, with particular genes being important for coupling PCNA loading/unloading (i.e. Ctf18, Elg1) with nucleosome assembly (i.e. CAF1, HIR).

A key mechanism of resistance to anti-androgens is through expression of constitutively active AR variants (AR-Vs) that are refractory to next-generation therapies, including Enzalutamide and Abiraterone. By maintaining an androgenic gene signature, AR-Vs drive tumour survival and progression in castrate conditions. Critically, however, our understanding of the mechanics of AR-V-driven transcription is limited, particularly with respect to dependency on pioneer factor function. Here we show that depletion of FOXA1 in the CWR22Rv1 CRPC cell line abrogates the oncogenic potential of AR-Vs. Gene expression profiling reveals that approximately 41\% of the AR-V transcriptome requires FOXA1 and that depletion of FOXA1 attenuates AR-V binding at a sub-set of analysed co-regulated genes. Interestingly, AR-V levels are elevated in cells depleted of FOXA1 as a consequence of attenuated negative feedback on the  AR  gene, but is insufficient to maintain cell growth as evidenced by marked anti-proliferative effects in FOXA1 knockdown cells. In all, our data suggests that AR-Vs are dependent on FOXA1 for sustaining a pro-proliferative gene signature and agents targeting FOXA1 may represent novel therapeutic options for CRPC patients.},

A key mechanism of therapy-resistance is by selection of AR mutations that convert anti-androgens to agonists enabling the retention of androgenic signalling in CRPC. To improve our understanding of these receptors in advanced disease we developed a physiologically-relevant model to analyse the global functionality of AR mutants in CRPC. Using the bicalutamide-activated AR W741L/C  mutation as proof of concept, we demonstrate that this mutant confers an androgenic-like signalling programme and growth promoting phenotype in the presence of bicalutamide. Transcriptomic profiling of AR W741L  highlighted key genes markedly up-regulated by the mutant receptor, including  TIPARP ,  RASD1  and  SGK1 . Importantly,  SGK1  expression was found to be highly expressed in the KUCaP xenograft model and a CRPC patient biopsy sample both of which express the bicalutamide-activated receptor mutant. Using an SGK1 inhibitor, AR W741L  transcriptional and growth promoting activity was reduced indicating that exploiting functional distinctions between receptor isoforms in our model may provide new and effective therapies for CRPC patients.},

Now, Duncan et al. report the case of a child and a newborn sibling with a homozygous mutation in the high-affinity interferon-α/β receptor (IFNAR2), which prevented cells from responding to IFN-α/β. The previously healthy proband developed fatal encephalitis after exposure to the live attenuated measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. Reconstituting the proband’s cells with IFNAR2 restored control of IFN-attenuated viruses. These data support an essential role for IFN-α/β in antiviral immunity.Type I interferon (IFN-α/β) is a fundamental antiviral defense mechanism. Mouse models have been pivotal to understanding the role of IFN-α/β in immunity, although validation of these findings in humans has been limited. We investigated a previously healthy child with fatal encephalitis after inoculation of the live attenuated measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. By targeted resequencing, we identified a homozygous mutation in the high-affinity IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR2) in the proband, as well as a newborn sibling, that rendered cells unresponsive to IFN-α/β. Reconstitution of the proband’s cells with wild-type IFNAR2 restored IFN-α/β responsiveness and control of IFN-attenuated viruses. Despite the severe outcome of systemic live vaccine challenge, the proband had previously shown no evidence of heightened susceptibility to respiratory viral pathogens. The phenotype of IFNAR2 deficiency, together with similar findings in STAT2-deficient patients, supports an essential but narrow role for IFN-α/β in human antiviral immunity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful, debilitating disease characterised by loss of articular cartilage with concurrent changes in other tissues of the synovial joint. Genetic association studies have shown that a number of common variants increase the risk of developing OA. Investigating their activity can uncover novel causal pathways and potentially highlight new treatment targets. One of the reported OA association signals is marked by the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11842874 at chromosome 13q34. rs11842874 is positioned within a small linkage disequilibrium (LD) block within intron 4 of MCF2L, a gene encoding guanine-nucleotide exchange factor DBS. There are no non-synonymous SNPs that correlate with this association signal and we therefore set out to assess whether its effect on OA susceptibility is mediated by alteration of MCF2L expression.
METHODS: Nucleic acid was extracted from cartilage, synovial membrane or infrapatellar fat pad tissues from OA patients. Expression of MCF2L was measured by quantitative PCR and RNA-sequencing whilst the presence of DBS was studied using immunohistochemistry. The functional effect of SNPs within the 13q34 locus was assessed using public databases and in vitro using luciferase reporter analysis.
RESULTS: MCF2L gene and protein expression are detectable in joint tissues, with quantitative differences in the expression of the gene and in the transcript isoforms expressed between the tissues tested. There is an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) operating within synovial membrane tissue, with possession of the risk-conferring A allele of rs11842874 correlating with increased MCF2L expression. SNPs within the rs11842874 LD block reside within transcriptional regulatory elements and their direct analysis reveals that several show quantitative differences in regulatory activity at the allelic level.
CONCLUSIONS: MCF2L is subject to a cis-acting eQTL in synovial membrane that correlates with the OA association signal. This signal contains several functional SNPs that could account for the susceptibility and which therefore merit further investigation. As far as we are aware, this is the first example of an OA susceptibility locus operating as an eQTL in synovial membrane tissue but not in cartilage.},

	abstract = {The REL gene, encoding the NF-κB subunit c-Rel, is frequently amplified in B-cell lymphoma and functions as a tumour-promoting transcription factor. Here we report the surprising result that c-rel-/- mice display significantly earlier lymphomagenesis in the c-Myc driven, Eμ-Myc model of B-cell lymphoma. c-Rel loss also led to earlier onset of disease in a separate TCL1-Tg-driven lymphoma model. Tumour reimplantation experiments indicated that this is an effect intrinsic to the Eμ-Myc lymphoma cells but, counterintuitively, c-rel-/- Eμ-Myc lymphoma cells were more sensitive to apoptotic stimuli. To learn more about why loss of c-Rel led to earlier onset of disease, microarray gene expression analysis was performed on B cells from 4-week-old, wild-type and c-rel-/- Eμ-Myc mice. Extensive changes in gene expression were not seen at this age, but among those transcripts significantly downregulated by the loss of c-Rel was the B-cell tumour suppressor BTB and CNC homology 2 (Bach2). Quantitative PCR and western blot analysis confirmed loss of Bach2 in c-Rel mutant Eμ-Myc tumours at both 4 weeks and the terminal stages of disease. Moreover, Bach2 expression was also downregulated in c-rel-/- TCL1-Tg mice and RelA Thr505Ala mutant Eμ-Myc mice. Analysis of wild-type Eμ-Myc mice demonstrated that the population expressing low levels of Bach2 exhibited the earlier onset of lymphoma seen in c-rel-/- mice. Confirming the relevance of these findings to human disease, analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data revealed that Bach2 is a c-Rel and NF-κB target gene in transformed human B cells, whereas treatment of Burkitt's lymphoma cells with inhibitors of the NF-κB/IκB kinase pathway or deletion of c-Rel or RelA resulted in loss of Bach2 expression. These data reveal a surprising tumour suppressor role for c-Rel in lymphoma development explained by regulation of Bach2 expression, underlining the context-dependent complexity of NF-κB signalling in cancer.Oncogene advance online publication, 2 November 2015; doi:10.1038/onc.2015.399.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a debilitating condition with a significant impact on patients' quality of life. Fatigue is frequently reported by patients suffering from primary Sjögren's Syndrome (pSS), a chronic autoimmune condition characterised by dryness of the eyes and the mouth. However, although fatigue is common in pSS, it does not manifest in all sufferers, providing an excellent model with which to explore the potential underpinning biological mechanisms.
METHODS: Whole blood samples from 133 fully-phenotyped pSS patients stratified for the presence of fatigue, collected by the UK primary Sjögren's Syndrome Registry, were used for whole genome microarray. The resulting data were analysed both on a gene by gene basis and using pre-defined groups of genes. Finally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used as a feature selection technique for input into a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Classification was assessed using area under curve (AUC) of receiver operator characteristic and standard error of Wilcoxon statistic, SE(W).
RESULTS: Although no genes were individually found to be associated with fatigue, 19 metabolic pathways were enriched in the high fatigue patient group using GSEA. Analysis revealed that these enrichments arose from the presence of a subset of 55 genes. A radial kernel SVM classifier with this subset of genes as input displayed significantly improved performance over classifiers using all pathway genes as input. The classifiers had AUCs of 0.866 (SE(W) 0.002) and 0.525 (SE(W) 0.006), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Systematic analysis of gene expression data from pSS patients discordant for fatigue identified 55 genes which are predictive of fatigue level using SVM classification. This list represents the first step in understanding the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of fatigue in patients with pSS.},

A targeted siRNA was used to deplete MTF1 expression in the human intestinal cell line Caco-2. We predicted that the response to zinc of direct MTF1 target genes would be abrogated by MTF1 knockdown. Surprisingly, a greater number of genes were regulated by zinc following MFT1 knockdown, and most genes that responded to zinc under both control and MTF1-depleted conditions had an augmented response in the latter condition. Exceptions were the zinc effluxer ZnT1 and a suite of metallothionein genes, suggesting that responses of other genes to zinc are usually buffered by increases in these proteins. We propose that MTF1 heads a hierarchy of zinc sensors, and through controlling the expression of a raft of metallothioneins and other key proteins involved in controlling intracellular zinc levels (e.g. ZnT1) alters zinc buffering capacity and total cellular zinc content. We tested and validated this model by overexpressing metallothionein and observing the predicted curtailment in response of the zinc-repressed SLC30A5 (ZnT5) promoter. The model provides the framework for an integrated understanding of cellular zinc homeostasis. Because MTs can bind metals other than zinc, this framework links with overall cellular metal homeostasis.},

Understanding the determinants of MDM2 inhibitor sensitivity is pertinent for their optimal clinical application. Wild-type p53-inducible phosphatase-1 (WIP1) encoded by PPM1D, is activated, gained/amplified in a range of TP53 wild-type malignancies and is involved in p53 stress response homeostasis. We investigated cellular growth/proliferation of TP53 wild-type and matched mutant/null cell line pairs, differing in PPM1D genetic status, in response to Nutlin-3/RG7388 + a highly selective WIP1 inhibitor GSK2830371. We also assessed the effects of GSK2830371 on MDM2 inhibitor induced p53(Ser15) phosphorylation p53-mediated global transcriptional activity and apoptosis. The investigated cell line pairs were relatively insensitive to single agent GSK2830371. However, a non-growth inhibitory dose of GSK2830371 markedly potentiated the response to MDM2 inhibitors in TP53 wild-type cell lines, most notably in those harbouring PPM1D activating mutations or copy number gain (up to 5.8-fold decrease in GI50). Potentiation also correlated with significant increase in MDM2 inhibitor induced cell death endpoints which were preceded by a marked increase in a WIP1 negatively regulated substrate, phosphorylated p53(Ser15), known to increase p53 transcriptional activity. Microarray-based gene expression analysis showed that the combination treatment increases the subset of early RG7388 induced p53-transcriptional target genes. These findings demonstrate that potent and selective WIP1 inhibition potentiates the response to MDM2 inhibitors in TP53 wild-type cells, particularly those with PPM1D activation or gain, while highlighting the mechanistic importance of p53(Ser15) and its potential use as a biomarker for response to this combination regimen.},

Among these, phosphorylation of the RelA(p65) Thr505 residue has been described as an important regulator of NF-κB activity in cell lines, but its physiological significance was not known. Therefore, to learn more about the role of this pathway in vivo, we generated a knockin mouse with a RelA T505A mutation. Unlike RelA knockout mice, the RelA T505A mice develop normally but exhibit aberrant hepatocyte proliferation following liver partial hepatectomy or damage resulting from carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) treatment. Consistent with these effects, RelA T505A mice exhibit earlier onset of cancer in the N-nitrosodiethylamine model of hepatocellular carcinoma. These data reveal a critical pathway controlling NF-κB function in the liver that acts to suppress the tumour-promoting activities of RelA.Oncogene advance online publication, 8 February 2016; doi:10.1038/onc.2015.526.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Gingival fibroblast-mediated extracellular matrix remodelling is implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontitis, yet the stimuli that regulate this response are not fully understood. The immunoregulatory adipokine leptin is detectable in the gingiva, human gingival fibroblasts express functional leptin receptor mRNA and leptin is known to regulate extracellular matrix remodelling responses in cardiac fibroblasts. We therefore hypothesised that leptin would enhance matrix metalloproteinase secretion in human gingival fibroblasts.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We used in vitro cell culture to investigate leptin signalling and the effect of leptin on mRNA and protein expression in human gingival fibroblasts. We confirmed human gingival fibroblasts expressed cell surface leptin receptor, found leptin increased matrix metalloproteinase-1, -3, -8 and -14 expression in human gingival fibroblasts compared to unstimulated cells, and observed that leptin stimulation activated MAPK, STAT1/3 and Akt signalling in human gingival fibroblasts. Furthermore, leptin synergised with IL-1 or the TLR2 agonist pam2CSK4 to markedly enhance matrix metalloproteinase-1 and -3 production by human gingival fibroblasts. Signalling pathway inhibition demonstrated ERK was required for leptin-stimulated matrix metalloproteinase-1 expression in human gingival fibroblasts; whilst ERK, JNK, p38 and STAT3 were required for leptin+IL-1- and leptin+pam2CSK4-induced matrix metalloproteinase-1 expression. A genome-wide expression array and gene ontology analysis confirmed genes differentially expressed in leptin+IL-1-stimulated human gingival fibroblasts (compared to unstimulated cells) were enriched for extracellular matrix organisation and disassembly, and revealed that matrix metalloproteinase-8 and -12 were also synergistically upregulated by leptin+IL-1 in human gingival fibroblasts.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that leptin selectively enhances the expression and secretion of certain matrix metalloproteinases in human gingival fibroblasts, and suggest that gingival fibroblasts may have an ECM-degrading phenotype during conditions of hyperleptinaemia (e.g., obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, exogenous leptin therapy).},

	abstract = {Reactive oxygen species, such as H2O2, can damage cells but also promote fundamental processes, including growth, differentiation and migration. The mechanisms allowing cells to differentially respond to toxic or signaling H2O2 levels are poorly defined. Here we reveal that increasing external H2O2 produces a bi-phasic response in intracellular H2O2. Peroxiredoxins (Prx) are abundant peroxidases which protect against genome instability, ageing and cancer. We have developed a dynamic model simulating in vivo changes in Prx oxidation. Remarkably, we show that the thioredoxin peroxidase activity of Prx does not provide any significant protection against external rises in H2O2. Instead, our model and experimental data are consistent with low levels of extracellular H2O2 being efficiently buffered by other thioredoxin-dependent activities, including H2O2-reactive cysteines in the thiol-proteome. We show that when extracellular H2O2 levels overwhelm this buffering capacity, the consequent rise in intracellular H2O2 triggers hyperoxidation of Prx to thioredoxin-resistant, peroxidase-inactive form/s. Accordingly, Prx hyperoxidation signals that H2O2 defenses are breached, diverting thioredoxin to repair damage.},

Using microarray analysis of miRNA expression during mesenchymal stem cell chondrogenic differentiation and detailed examination of the role of essential differentiation factors, such as SOX9, TGF-β, and the cell condensation phase, we characterize the repertoire of specific miRNAs involved in chondrocyte development, highlighting in particular miR-140 and miR-455. Further with the use of mRNA microarray data we integrate miRNA expression and mRNA expression during chondrogenesis to underline the particular importance of miR-140, especially the -5p strand. We provide a detailed identification and validation of direct targets of miR-140-5p in both chondrogenesis and adult chondrocytes with the use of microarray and 3'UTR analysis. This emphasizes the diverse array of targets and pathways regulated by miR-140-5p. We are also able to confirm previous experimentally identified targets but, additionally, identify a novel positive regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway by miR-140-5p. Wnt signaling has a complex role in chondrogenesis and skeletal development and these findings illustrate a previously unidentified role for miR-140-5p in regulation of Wnt signaling in these processes. Together these developments further highlight the role of miRNAs during chondrogenesis to improve our understanding of chondrocyte development and guide cartilage tissue engineering.},

	abstract = {In platelets, splicing and translation occur in the absence of a nucleus. However, the integrity and stability of mRNAs derived from megakaryocyte progenitor cells remain poorly quantified on a transcriptome-wide level. As circular RNAs (circRNAs) are resistant to degradation by exonucleases, their abundance relative to linear RNAs can be used as a surrogate marker for mRNA stability in the absence of transcription. Here we show that circRNAs are enriched in human platelets 17- to 188-fold relative to nucleated tissues and 14- to 26-fold relative to samples digested with RNAse R to selectively remove linear RNA. We compare RNAseq read depths inside and outside circRNAs to provide in silico evidence of transcript circularity, show that exons within circRNAs are enriched on average 12.7 times in platelets relative to nucleated tissues and identify 3162 genes significantly enriched for circRNAs, including some where all RNAseq reads appear to be derived from circular molecules. We also confirm that this is a feature of other anucleate cells through transcriptome sequencing of mature erythrocytes, demonstrate that circRNAs are not enriched in cultured megakaryocytes, and demonstrate that linear RNAs decay more rapidly than circRNAs in platelet preparations. Collectively, these results suggest that circulating platelets have lost {\textgreater}90\% of their progenitor mRNAs and that translation in platelets occurs against the backdrop of a highly degraded transcriptome. Finally, we find that transcripts previously classified as products of reverse transcriptase template switching are both enriched in platelets and resistant to decay, countering the recent suggestion that up to 50\% of rearranged RNAs are artifacts.},

	abstract = {Drug development is both increasing in cost whilst decreasing in productivity. There is a general acceptance that the current paradigm of R\&D needs to change. One alternative approach is drug repositioning. With target-based approaches utilised heavily in the field of drug discovery, it becomes increasingly necessary to have a systematic method to rank gene-disease associations. Although methods already exist to collect, integrate and score these associations, they are often not a reliable reflection of expert knowledge. Furthermore, the amount of data available in all areas covered by bioinformatics is increasing dramatically year on year. It thus makes sense to move away from more generalised hypothesis driven approaches to research to one that allows data to generate their own hypothesis. We introduce an integrated, data driven approach to drug repositioning. We first apply a Bayesian statistics approach to rank 309,885 gene-disease associations using existing knowledge. Ranked associations are then integrated with other biological data to produce a semantically-rich drug discovery network. Using this network, we show how our approach identifies diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) to be an area of interest. CNS disorders are identified due to the low numbers of such disorders that currently have marketed treatments, in comparison to other therapeutic areas. We then systematically mine our network for semantic subgraphs that allow us to infer drug-disease relations that are not captured in the network. We identify and rank 275,934 drug-disease has\_indication associations after filtering those that are more likely to be side effects, whilst commenting on the top ranked associations in more detail. The dataset has been created in Neo4j and is available for download at https://bitbucket.org/ncl-intbio/genediseaserepositioning along with a Java implementation of the searching algorithm.},

We observed that 254 genes and 26 proteins implicated in cancer (80\%), immune function and inflammatory response (40\%), cell growth and proliferation (70\%), cellular movement, and cell death (50\%) were differentially expressed between the 2 groups. Expression of 69 genes, including selenoproteins W1 and K, which are genes involved in cytoskeleton remodelling and transcription factor NFκB signaling, correlated significantly with Se status. Integrating proteomics and transcriptomics datasets revealed reduced inflammatory and immune responses and cytoskeleton remodelling in the suboptimal Se status group.

Improved understanding of the genomic landscape of iAMP21-ALL will ascertain whether these patients may benefit from targeted therapy. We performed whole-exome sequencing of eight iAMP21-ALL samples. The mutation rate was dramatically disparate between cases (average 24.9, range 5-51) and a large number of novel variants were identified, including frequent mutation of the RAS/MEK/ERK pathway. Targeted sequencing of a larger cohort revealed that 60\% (25/42) of diagnostic iAMP21-ALL samples harboured 42 distinct RAS pathway mutations. High sequencing coverage demonstrated heterogeneity in the form of multiple RAS pathway mutations within the same sample and diverse variant allele frequencies (VAFs) (2-52\%), similar to other subtypes of ALL. Constitutive RAS pathway activation was observed in iAMP21 samples that harboured mutations in the predominant clone (⩾35\% VAF). Viable iAMP21 cells from primary xenografts showed reduced viability in response to the MEK1/2 inhibitor, selumetinib, in vitro. As clonal (⩾35\% VAF) mutations were detected in 26\% (11/42) of iAMP21-ALL, this evidence of response to RAS pathway inhibitors may offer the possibility to introduce targeted therapy to improve therapeutic efficacy in these high-risk patients.Leukemia advance online publication, 10 May 2016; doi:10.1038/leu.2016.80.},

Genetic variants and environmental cues influence predisposition to the development of chronic liver disease; however, it remains unknown if aberrant DNA methylation is associated with fibrosis progression in chronic hepatitis B.
RESULTS: To identify epigenetic marks associated with inflammatory and fibrotic processes of the hepatitis B-induced chronic liver disease, we carried out hepatic genome-wide methylation profiling using Illumina Infinium BeadArrays comparing mild and severe fibrotic disease in a discovery cohort of 29 patients. We obtained 310 differentially methylated regions and selected four loci comprising three genes from the top differentially methylated regions: hypermethylation of HOXA2 and HDAC4 along with hypomethylation of PPP1R18 were significantly linked to severe fibrosis. We replicated the prominent methylation marks in an independent cohort of 102 patients by bisulfite modification and pyrosequencing. The timing and causal relationship of epigenetic modifications with disease severity was further investigated using a cohort of patients with serial biopsies.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a linkage of widespread epigenetic dysregulation with disease progression in chronic hepatitis B infection. CpG methylation at novel genes sheds light on new molecular pathways, which can be potentially exploited as a biomarker or targeted to attenuate inflammation and fibrosis.},

We analyzed the fidelity of nascent RNAs from all actively transcribing elongation complexes (ECs) in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and found that 1–3\% of all ECs in wild-type cells, and 5–7\% of all ECs in cells lacking proofreading factors are, in fact, misincorporated complexes. With the exception of a number of sequence-dependent hotspots, most misincorporations are distributed relatively randomly. Misincorporation at hotspots does not appear to be stimulated by pausing. Since misincorporation leads to a strong pause of transcription due to backtracking, our findings indicate that misincorporation could be a major source of transcriptional pausing and lead to conflicts with other RNA polymerases and replication in bacteria and eukaryotes. This observation implies that physical resolution of misincorporated complexes may be the main function of the proofreading factors Gre and TFIIS. Although misincorporation mechanisms between bacteria and eukaryotes appear to be conserved, the results suggest the existence of a bacteria-specific mechanism(s) for reducing misincorporation in protein-coding regions. The links between transcription fidelity, human disease, and phenotypic variability in genetically-identical cells can be explained by the accumulation of misincorporated complexes, rather than mistakes in mature RNA.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in single cell analysis have demonstrated genetic heterogeneity amongst cells from the same tumour population. The propagating compartment in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) has been shown to undergo clonal evolution, leading to the co-existence of subclones with different copy number alterations or mutations. Certain subclones may respond differently to selective pressures such as therapy, resulting in clonal selection and relapse. However, little is known about how this apparent genetic heterogeneity translates to functional heterogeneity amongst the bulk population of ALL blasts, particularly under non-selective conditions. Although it is thought that a high proportion of blasts have the potential to engraft immunocompromised mice, it is unclear whether in practice the leukaemia is dominated by smaller numbers of clones and how this complexity changes over serial transplants or in selective environments.
To address these questions, we have used cellular barcoding as a fate mapping tool to track the engraftment and evolution of individual clones within a bulk tumour population. Cellular barcoding involves labelling cells with a random genetic barcode which is delivered using a lentiviral vector, so is both stable and heritable. We created a barcode library with a complexity in excess of 100,000 and used it to label ALL primograft leukaemia samples, which were subsequently transplanted serially into NOD/LtSz-scid IL-2Rγ null (NSG) mice.
Analysis of barcode composition in 3 primograft samples revealed that founder clones were highly abundant. Engraftment frequencies were estimated at between 1 in 2 to 1 in 14 (L4951, t(9;22)); 1 in 4 to 1 in 6 (L707, t(17;19)) and 1 in 19 (P929, t(4;11)). Following transplant of high cell numbers (10,000 barcoded), spleen samples contained high numbers of detectable barcodes (600-900). These contributed to the bulk population at similar frequencies, with no single barcode composing more than 5\%. These clonal compositions were maintained in secondary recipients. This lack of dominance is suggestive of functional homogeneity within the propagating cell population under steady state conditions. In support of this, limiting dilution analysis revealed that all clones in the spleen have the capacity to engraft the leukaemia in the CNS and femoral bone marrow. We obtained several cases of near identical barcode composition in all sites, including one where a single barcode comprised the leukaemia in all organs.
Although all subclones had the capability to reconstitute the leukaemia in all organs, we also found evidence of clonal dominance under selective conditions. Small numbers of barcodes were often dominant in femur and CNS compartments, with single barcodes comprising up to 80\% of the tumour population. This occurred more frequently at high transplant doses and was not found in the spleens, so may be due to competitive pressures in restrictive microenvironments such as the femur. These barcodes did not become dominant when samples were re-transplanted into secondary recipients, suggesting the dominance was due to stochastic founder effects as opposed to intrinsic properties of these clones. In contrast, selection of clones with increased fitness was observed under dexamethasone treatment in mice transplanted with sample L707. Treated mice had a substantial reduction in clonal complexity in spleen samples, with single barcodes comprising up to 85\% of the tumour. For samples with lower initial complexity, dominant barcodes were the same in multiple mice, suggesting the existence of pre-existing clones with dexamethasone resistance.
In summary, we have demonstrated that many founder clones engraft and maintain the leukaemia in primary and secondary mice. This abundance of founder cells does not result in functional heterogeneity under constant selective conditions. Instead, the propagating cells are functionally homogenous, being able to contribute equally to leukaemia in the spleen and having the capability to reconstitute leukaemia in other organs. This homogeneity may reflect the typically low genomic instability in ALL. Clonal dominance only occurs under selective pressures, either stochastically through founder effects in potentially restrictive microenvironments, or selection in response to drug treatment.

Although inflammation is most commonly associated with inflammatory joint diseases, it also occurs in OA and is thus relevant to the prevalent tissue destruction. Here, inflammation generates a cFOS AP-1 early response which indirectly affects MMP13 gene expression. To ascertain a more a direct effect on prolonged MMP13 production we examined the potential molecular events occurring between the rapid, transient expression of cFOS and the subsequent MMP13 induction. Importantly, we show MMP13 mRNA expression is mirrored by nascent hnRNA transcription. Employing ChIP assays, cFOS recruitment to the MMP13 promoter occurs at an early stage prior to gene transcription and that recruitment of transcriptional initiation markers also correlated with MMP13 expression. Moreover, protein synthesis inhibition following early cFOS expression resulted in a significant decrease in MMP13 expression thus indicating a role for different regulatory factors modulating expression of the gene. Subsequent mRNA transcriptome analyses highlighted several genes induced soon after cFOS that could contribute to MMP13 expression. Specific small interfering RNA-mediated silencing highlighted that ATF3 was as highly selective for MMP13 as cFOS. Moreover, ATF3 expression was AP-1(cFOS/cJUN)-dependent and expression levels were maintained after the early transient cFOS response. Furthermore, ATF3 bound the proximal MMP13 AP-1 motif in stimulated chondrocytes at time-points that no longer supported binding of cFOS. Consequently, these findings support roles for both cFOS (indirect) and ATF3 (direct) in effecting MMP13 transcription in human chondrocytes.},

	abstract = {The androgen receptor (AR) is the main driver of prostate cancer (PC) development and progression, and the primary therapeutic target in PC. To date, two functional ubiquitination sites have been identified on AR, both located in its C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD). Recent reports highlight the emergence of AR splice variants lacking the LBD that can arise during disease progression and contribute to castrate resistance. Here, we report a novel N-terminal ubiquitination site at lysine 311. Ubiquitination of this site plays a role in AR stability and is critical for its transcriptional activity. Inactivation of this site causes AR to accumulate on chromatin and inactivates its transcriptional function as a consequence of inability to bind to p300. Additionally, mutation at lysine 311 affects cellular transcriptome altering the expression of genes involved in chromatin organization, signaling, adhesion, motility, development and metabolism. Even though this site is present in clinically relevant AR-variants it can only be ubiquitinated in cells when AR retains LBD suggesting a role for AR C-terminus in E2/E3 substrate recognition. We report that as a consequence AR variants lacking the LBD cannot be ubiquitinated in the cellular environment and their protein turnover must be regulated via an alternate pathway.},

	abstract = {Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) patients frequently experience well formed recurrent complex visual hallucinations (RCVH). This is associated with reduced blood flow or hypometabolism on imaging of the primary visual cortex. To understand these associations in DLB we used pathological and biochemical analysis of the primary visual cortex to identify changes that could underpin RCVH. Alpha-synuclein or neurofibrillary tangle pathology in primary visual cortex was essentially absent. Neurone density or volume within the primary visual cortex in DLB was also unchanged using unbiased stereology. Microarray analysis, however, demonstrated changes in neuropeptide gene expression and other markers, indicating altered GABAergic neuronal function. Calcium binding protein and GAD65/67 immunohistochemistry showed preserved interneurone populations indicating possible interneurone dysfunction. This was demonstrated by loss of post synaptic GABA receptor markers including gephyrin, GABARAP, and Kif5A, indicating reduced GABAergic synaptic activity. Glutamatergic neuronal signalling was also altered with vesicular glutamate transporter protein and PSD-95 expression being reduced. Changes to the primary visual cortex in DLB indicate that reduced GABAergic transmission may contribute to RCVH in DLB and treatment using targeted GABAergic modulation or similar approaches using glutamatergic modification may be beneficial.},

We aimed to determine the clinical and genetic landscape of those with IGH-CRLF2 or P2RY8-CRLF2 (CRLF2-r) using multiple genomic approaches. Clinical and demographic features of CRLF2-r patients were characteristic of B-ALL. Patients with IGH-CRLF2 were older (14 y vs. 4 y, P {\textless} .001), while the incidence of CRLF2-r among Down syndrome patients was high (50/161, 31\%). CRLF2-r co-occurred with primary chromosomal rearrangements but the majority (111/161, 69\%) had B-other ALL. Copy number alteration (CNA) profiles were similar to B-other ALL, although CRLF2-r patients harbored higher frequencies of IKZF1 (60/138, 43\% vs. 77/1351, 24\%) and BTG1 deletions (20/138, 15\% vs. 3/1351, 1\%). There were significant differences in CNA profiles between IGH-CRLF2 and P2RY8-CRLF2 patients: IKZF1 (25/35, 71\% vs. 36/108, 33\%, P {\textless} .001), BTG1 (11/35, 31\% vs. 10/108, 9\%, P =.004), and ADD3 deletions (9/19, 47\% vs. 5/38, 13\%, P =.008). A novel gene fusion, USP9X-DDX3X, was discovered in 10/54 (19\%) of patients. Pathway analysis of the mutational profile revealed novel involvement for focal adhesion. Although the functional relevance of many of these abnormalities are unknown, they likely activate additional pathways, which may represent novel therapeutic targets.},

However, the boundaries of the transcribed regions, conditional operon structures, non-coding RNAs and the dynamics of transcription, such as pausing of elongation, are non-trivial to identify, even in the comparatively simple genomes of prokaryotes. Traditional methods for the study of these areas, such as tiling arrays, are noisy, labour-intensive and lack the resolution required for densely-packed bacterial genomes. Recently, deep sequencing has become increasingly popular for the study of the transcriptome due to its lower costs, higher accuracy and single nucleotide resolution. These methods have revolutionised our understanding of prokaryotic transcriptional dynamics. Here, we review the deep sequencing and data analysis techniques that are available for the study of transcription in prokaryotes, and discuss the bioinformatic considerations of these analyses.},

	abstract = {Inhibition of monocarboxylate transporter 1 has been proposed as a therapeutic approach to perturb lactate shuttling in tumor cells that lack monocarboxylate transporter 4. We examined the monocarboxylate transporter 1 inhibitor AZD3965, currently in phase I clinical studies, as a potential therapy for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma. Whilst extensive monocarboxylate transporter 1 protein was found in 120 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and 10 Burkitt lymphoma patient tumors, monocarboxylate transporter 4 protein expression was undetectable in 73\% of the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma samples and undetectable or negligible in each Burkitt lymphoma sample. AZD3965 treatment led to a rapid accumulation of intracellular lactate in a panel of lymphoma cell lines with low monocarboxylate transporter 4 protein expression and potently inhibited their proliferation. Metabolic changes induced by AZD3965 in lymphoma cells were consistent with a feedback inhibition on glycolysis. A profound cytostatic response was also observed in vivo: daily oral AZD3965 treatment for 24 days, inhibited CA46 Burkitt lymphoma growth by 99\%. Continuous exposure of CA46 cells to AZD3965 for 7 weeks in vitro resulted in a greater dependency upon oxidative phosphorylation. Combining AZD3965 with an inhibitor of mitochondrial Complex I (central to oxidative phosphorylation) induced significant lymphoma cell death in vitro and reduced CA46 disease burden in vivo. These data support clinical examination of AZD3965 in Burkitt lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients with low tumor monocarboxylate transporter 4 expression and highlight the potential of combination strategies to optimally target the metabolic phenotype of tumors.},

	doi = {10.1016/S1470-2045(17)30243-7},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: International consensus recognises four medulloblastoma molecular subgroups: WNT (MBWNT), SHH (MBSHH), group 3 (MBGrp3), and group 4 (MBGrp4), each defined by their characteristic genome-wide transcriptomic and DNA methylomic profiles. These subgroups have distinct clinicopathological and molecular features, and underpin current disease subclassification and initial subgroup-directed therapies that are underway in clinical trials. However, substantial biological heterogeneity and differences in survival are apparent within each subgroup, which remain to be resolved. We aimed to investigate whether additional molecular subgroups exist within childhood medulloblastoma and whether these could be used to improve disease subclassification and prognosis predictions.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we assessed 428 primary medulloblastoma samples collected from UK Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) treatment centres (UK), collaborating European institutions, and the UKCCSG-SIOP-PNET3 European clinical trial. An independent validation cohort (n=276) of archival tumour samples was also analysed. We analysed samples from patients with childhood medulloblastoma who were aged 0-16 years at diagnosis, and had central review of pathology and comprehensive clinical data. We did comprehensive molecular profiling, including DNA methylation microarray analysis, and did unsupervised class discovery of test and validation cohorts to identify consensus primary molecular subgroups and characterise their clinical and biological significance. We modelled survival of patients aged 3-16 years in patients (n=215) who had craniospinal irradiation and had been treated with a curative intent.
FINDINGS: Seven robust and reproducible primary molecular subgroups of childhood medulloblastoma were identified. MBWNT remained unchanged and each remaining consensus subgroup was split in two. MBSHH was split into age-dependent subgroups corresponding to infant ({\textless}4·3 years; MBSHH-Infant; n=65) and childhood patients (≥4·3 years; MBSHH-Child; n=38). MBGrp3 and MBGrp4 were each split into high-risk (MBGrp3-HR [n=65] and MBGrp4-HR [n=85]) and low-risk (MBGrp3-LR [n=50] and MBGrp4-LR [n=73]) subgroups. These biological subgroups were validated in the independent cohort. We identified features of the seven subgroups that were predictive of outcome. Cross-validated subgroup-dependent survival models, incorporating these novel subgroups along with secondary clinicopathological and molecular features and established disease risk-factors, outperformed existing disease risk-stratification schemes. These subgroup-dependent models stratified patients into four clinical risk groups for 5-year progression-free survival: favourable risk (54 [25\%] of 215 patients; 91\% survival [95\% CI 82-100]); standard risk (50 [23\%] patients; 81\% survival [70-94]); high-risk (82 [38\%] patients; 42\% survival [31-56]); and very high-risk (29 [13\%] patients; 28\% survival [14-56]).
INTERPRETATION: The discovery of seven novel, clinically significant subgroups improves disease risk-stratification and could inform treatment decisions. These data provide a new foundation for future research and clinical investigations.

Gene expression of GPX1 and SELENOP and genotyping were measured by real-time PCR using TaqMan Assays. Global gene expression was assessed by microarray using Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 BeadChips. Brazil nut supplementation significantly increased GPX1 mRNA expression only in subjects with CC genotype at rs1050450 (p {\textless} 0.05). SELENOP mRNA expression was significantly higher in A-carriers at rs7579 either before or after supplementation (p {\textless} 0.05).
