	abstract = {The seed proteome of a low phytic acid (lpa) rice line (Os-lpa-XS110-1), developed as a novel food source, was compared to that of its parental line, Xiushui 110 (XS-110). Analysis by surfaced enhanced laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) allowed the detection of a potential low molecular weight biomarker and identification of 23 differentially expressed proteins that include stress-related proteins, storage proteins, and potential allergens. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) and fructose bisphosphatealdolase (FBA), two major differentially expressed proteins, are involved in myo-inositol metabolism. Accumulation of globulin was also significantly decreased in the lpa line. This study demonstrates the potential of proteomic and bioinformatic profiling techniques for safety assessment of novel foods. Furthermore, these techniques provide powerful tools for studying functional genomics due to the possibility of identifying genes related to the mutated traits.},

	doi = {10.1186/gb-2008-9-10-r146},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telomeres prevent the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes from being recognized as damaged DNA and protect against cancer and ageing. When telomere structure is perturbed, a co-ordinated series of events promote arrest of the cell cycle so that cells carrying damaged telomeres do not divide. In order to better understand the eukaryotic response to telomere damage, budding yeast strains harboring a temperature sensitive allele of an essential telomere capping gene (cdc13-1) were subjected to a transcriptomic study.
RESULTS: The genome-wide response to uncapped telomeres in yeast cdc13-1 strains, which have telomere capping defects at temperatures above approximately 27 degrees C, was determined. Telomere uncapping in cdc13-1 strains is associated with the differential expression of over 600 transcripts. Transcripts affecting responses to DNA damage and diverse environmental stresses were statistically over-represented. BNA2, required for the biosynthesis of NAD+, is highly and significantly up-regulated upon telomere uncapping in cdc13-1 strains. We find that deletion of BNA2 and NPT1, which is also involved in NAD+ synthesis, suppresses the temperature sensitivity of cdc13-1 strains, indicating that NAD+ metabolism may be linked to telomere end protection.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the hypothesis that the response to telomere uncapping is related to, but distinct from, the response to non-telomeric double-strand breaks. The induction of environmental stress responses may be a conserved feature of the eukaryotic response to telomere damage. BNA2, which is involved in NAD+ synthesis, plays previously unidentified roles in the cellular response to telomere uncapping.},

In vitro, S. gordonii is conditionally auxotrophic for arginine in monoculture but biosynthesises arginine when coaggregated with Actinomyces oris. Here, we investigated the arginine-responsive regulatory network of S. gordonii and the basis for conditional arginine auxotrophy. ArcB, the catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase involved in arginine degradation, was also essential for arginine biosynthesis. However, arcB was poorly expressed following arginine depletion, indicating that arcB levels may limit S. gordonii arginine biosynthesis. Arginine metabolism gene expression was tightly co-ordinated by three ArgR/AhrC family regulators, encoded by argR, ahrC and arcR genes. Microarray analysis revealed that {\textgreater} 450 genes were regulated in response to rapid shifts in arginine concentration, including many genes involved in adhesion and biofilm formation. In a microfluidic salivary biofilm model, low concentrations of arginine promoted S. gordonii growth, whereas high concentrations ({\textgreater} 5 mM arginine) resulted in dramatic reductions in biofilm biomass and changes to biofilm architecture. Collectively, these data indicate that arginine metabolism is tightly regulated in S. gordonii and that arginine is critical for gene regulation, cellular growth and biofilm formation. Manipulating exogenous arginine concentrations may be an attractive approach for oral biofilm control.},

The goal of this study was to investigate whether DNA methylation levels at birth are associated with body size later in childhood. Principal Findings A study design involving two birth cohorts was used to conduct transcription profiling followed by DNA methylation analysis in peripheral blood. Gene expression analysis was undertaken in 24 individuals whose biological samples and clinical data were collected at a mean ± standard deviation (SD) age of 12.35 (0.95) years, the upper and lower tertiles of body mass index (BMI) were compared with a mean (SD) BMI difference of 9.86 (2.37) kg/m2. This generated a panel of differentially expressed genes for DNA methylation analysis which was then undertaken in cord blood DNA in 178 individuals with body composition data prospectively collected at a mean (SD) age of 9.83 (0.23) years. Twenty-nine differentially expressed genes ({\textgreater}1.2-fold and p{\textless}10−4) were analysed to determine DNA methylation levels at 1–3 sites per gene. Five genes were unmethylated and DNA methylation in the remaining 24 genes was analysed using linear regression with bootstrapping. Methylation in 9 of the 24 (37.5\%) genes studied was associated with at least one index of body composition (BMI, fat mass, lean mass, height) at age 9 years, although only one of these associations remained after correction for multiple testing (ALPL with height, pCorrected = 0.017). Conclusions DNA methylation patterns in cord blood show some association with altered gene expression, body size and composition in childhood. The observed relationship is correlative and despite suggestion of a mechanistic epigenetic link between in utero life and later phenotype, further investigation is required to establish causality.},

	abstract = {Objective We sought clinically relevant predictive biomarkers present in CD4 T-cells, or in serum, that identified those patients with undifferentiated arthritis (UA) who subsequently develop rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Methods Total RNA was isolated from highly purified peripheral blood CD4 T cells of 173 early arthritis clinic patients. Paired serum samples were also stored. Microarray analysis of RNA samples was performed and differential transcript expression among 111 ‘training cohort’ patients confirmed using real-time quantitative PCR. Machine learning approaches tested the utility of a classification model among an independent validation cohort presenting with UA (62 patients). Cytokine measurements were performed using a highly sensitive electrochemiluminescence detection system.
Results A 12-gene transcriptional ‘signature’ identified RA patients in the training cohort and predicted the subsequent development of RA among UA patients in the validation cohort (sensitivity 68\%, specificity 70\%). STAT3-inducible genes were over-represented in the signature, particularly in anti-citrullinated peptide antibody-negative disease, providing a risk metric of similar predictive value to the Leiden score in seronegative UA (sensitivity 85\%, specificity 75\%). Baseline levels of serum interleukin 6 (IL-6) (which signals via STAT3) were highest in anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies-negative RA and distinguished this subgroup from non-RA inflammatory synovitis (corrected p{\textless}0.05).Paired serum IL-6 measurements correlated strongly with STAT3-inducible gene expression.
Conclusion The authors have identified IL-6-mediated STAT-3 signalling in CD4 T cells during the earliest clinical phase of RA, which is most prominent in seronegative disease. While highlighting potential biomarker(s) for early RA, the role of this pathway in disease pathogenesis awaits clarification.},

	volume = {9},
	issn = {1479-7364},
	doi = {10.1186/s40246-015-0036-0},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: SIRT1 is likely to play a role in the extension in healthspan induced by dietary restriction. Actions of SIRT1 are pleiotropic, and effects on healthspan may include effects on DNA methylation. Polycomb group protein target genes (PCGTs) are suppressed by epigenetic mechanisms in stem cells, partly through the actions of the polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs), and have been shown previously to correspond with loci particularly susceptible to age-related changes in DNA methylation. We hypothesised that SIRT1 would affect DNA methylation particularly at PCGTs. To map the sites in the genome where SIRT1 affects DNA methylation, we altered SIRT1 expression in human intestinal (Caco-2) and vascular endothelial (HuVEC) cells by transient transfection with an expression construct or with siRNA. DNA was enriched for the methylated fraction then sequenced (HuVEC) or hybridised to a human promoter microarray (Caco-2).
RESULTS: The profile of genes where SIRT1 manipulation affected DNA methylation was enriched for PCGTs in both cell lines, thus supporting our hypothesis. SIRT1 knockdown affected the mRNA for none of seven PRC components nor for DNMT1 or DNMT3b. We thus find no evidence that SIRT1 affects DNA methylation at PCGTs by affecting the expression of these gene transcripts. EZH2, a component of PRC2 that can affect DNA methylation through association with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), did not co-immunoprecipitate with SIRT1, and SIRT1 knockdown did not affect the expression of EZH2 protein. Thus, it is unlikely that the effects of SIRT1 on DNA methylation at PCGTs are mediated through direct intermolecular association with EZH2 or through effects in its expression.
CONCLUSIONS: SIRT1 affects DNA methylation across the genome, but particularly at PCGTs. Although the mechanism through which SIRT1 has these effects is yet to be uncovered, this action is likely to contribute to extended healthspan, for example under conditions of dietary restriction.},

Methods The gene expression profiles of HUVEC and matched unpassaged human choroidal, retinal and iris endothelial cells were conducted using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. Selected differences were confirmed by real time PCR. Functional cell proliferation assays were used to support microarray findings.
Results HUVEC showed enrichment for probe sets involved in embryological development while ocular MVEC demonstrated enrichment for probe sets for MHC classes I and II, immune responses and cell signal transduction. Comparison of human retinal and choroidal endothelial cells demonstrated significant differences in the expression of probe sets encoding insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signalling. Cell proliferation assays demonstrated the stimulatory role of IGF-1 on retinal endothelial cells compared with choroidal endothelial cells.
Conclusions Gene expression profiling has demonstrated that HUVEC are probably not a suitable surrogate for the study of ocular angiogenic disorders. There are also significant differences in the gene expression of human retinal and choroidal endothelial cells, which may be important in the mechanism and treatment of choroidal and retinal neovascularisation.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-6-264},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: maxdLoad2 is a relational database schema and Java application for microarray experimental annotation and storage. It is compliant with all standards for microarray meta-data capture; including the specification of what data should be recorded, extensive use of standard ontologies and support for data exchange formats. The output from maxdLoad2 is of a form acceptable for submission to the ArrayExpress microarray repository at the European Bioinformatics Institute. maxdBrowse is a PHP web-application that makes contents of maxdLoad2 databases accessible via web-browser, the command-line and web-service environments. It thus acts as both a dissemination and data-mining tool.
RESULTS: maxdLoad2 presents an easy-to-use interface to an underlying relational database and provides a full complement of facilities for browsing, searching and editing. There is a tree-based visualization of data connectivity and the ability to explore the links between any pair of data elements, irrespective of how many intermediate links lie between them. Its principle novel features are: the flexibility of the meta-data that can be captured, the tools provided for importing data from spreadsheets and other tabular representations, the tools provided for the automatic creation of structured documents, the ability to browse and access the data via web and web-services interfaces. Within maxdLoad2 it is very straightforward to customise the meta-data that is being captured or change the definitions of the meta-data. These meta-data definitions are stored within the database itself allowing client software to connect properly to a modified database without having to be specially configured. The meta-data definitions (configuration file) can also be centralized allowing changes made in response to revisions of standards or terminologies to be propagated to clients without user intervention.maxdBrowse is hosted on a web-server and presents multiple interfaces to the contents of maxd databases. maxdBrowse emulates many of the browse and search features available in the maxdLoad2 application via a web-browser. This allows users who are not familiar with maxdLoad2 to browse and export microarray data from the database for their own analysis. The same browse and search features are also available via command-line and SOAP server interfaces. This both enables scripting of data export for use embedded in data repositories and analysis environments, and allows access to the maxd databases via web-service architectures.
CONCLUSION: maxdLoad2 http://www.bioinf.man.ac.uk/microarray/maxd/ and maxdBrowse http://dbk.ch.umist.ac.uk/maxdBrowse are portable and compatible with all common operating systems and major database servers. They provide a powerful, flexible package for annotation of microarray experiments and a convenient dissemination environment.

	abstract = {Information theory, the mathematical theory of communication in the presence of noise, is playing an increasingly important role in modern quantitative neuroscience. It makes it possible to treat neural systems as stochastic communication channels and gain valuable, quantitative insights into their sensory coding function. These techniques provide results on how neurons encode stimuli in a way which is independent of any specific assumptions on which part of the neuronal response is signal and which is noise, and they can be usefully applied even to highly non-linear systems where traditional techniques fail. In this article, we describe our work and experiences using Python for information theoretic analysis. We outline some of the algorithmic, statistical and numerical challenges in the computation of information theoretic quantities from neural data. In particular, we consider the problems arising from limited sampling bias and from calculation of maximum entropy distributions in the presence of constraints representing the effects of different orders of interaction in the system. We explain how and why using Python has allowed us to significantly improve the speed and domain of applicability of the information theoretic algorithms, allowing analysis of data sets characterized by larger numbers of variables. We also discuss how our use of Python is facilitating integration with collaborative databases and centralised computational resources.},

	abstract = {Author Summary Although the classical NF-κB pathway is frequently associated with the induction of cellular senescence and the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP), the role of the alternative NF-κB pathway, which is frequently activated in hematological malignancies as well as some solid tumors, has not been defined. We therefore investigated the role of the alternative NF-κB pathway in this process. Here we report that NF-κB2 and RelB, the effectors of the alternative NF-κB pathway, suppress senescence through inhibition of p53 activity. Using primary human fibroblasts, we demonstrate that this is accomplished through NF-κB2/RelB dependent control of a previously unknown pathway, incorporating regulation of CDK4 and 6 expression as well as regulators of p21WAF1 and p53 protein stability. Loss of NF-κB2/RelB results in suppression of retinoblastoma (Rb) tumour suppressor phosphorylation, which in turn leads to inhibition of EZH2 expression and de-repression of p53 activity. Interestingly, we find that CD40 ligand stimulation of cells from Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia patients, which strongly induces the alternative NF-κB pathway, also induces EZH2 expression. We propose that the alternative NF-κB pathway can promote tumorigenesis through suppression of p53 dependent senescence, a process that may have relevance to cancer cells retaining wild type p53.},

	abstract = {Rapid postnatal growth is associated with increased risk of childhood adiposity. The aim of this study was to establish whether this pathway is mediated by altered DNA methylation and gene expression. Two distinct cohorts, one preterm (n = 121) and one term born (n = 6,990), were studied. Exploratory analyses were performed using microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes in whole blood from children defined as “slow” (n = 10) compared with “rapid” (n = 10) postnatal (term to 12 weeks corrected age) growers. Methylation within the identified TACSTD2 gene was measured in both cohorts, and rs61779296 genotype was determined by Pyrosequencing or imputation and analyzed in relation to body composition at 9–15 years of age. In cohort 1, TACSTD2 expression was inversely correlated with methylation (P = 0.016), and both measures were associated with fat mass (expression, P = 0.049; methylation, P = 0.037). Although associated with gene expression (cohort 1, P = 0.008) and methylation (cohort 1, P = 2.98 × 10−11; cohort 2, P = 3.43 × 10−15), rs61779296 was not associated with postnatal growth or fat mass in either cohort following multiple regression analysis. Hence, the lack of association between fat mass and a methylation proxy SNP suggests that reverse causation or confounding may explain the initial association between fat mass and gene regulation. Noncausal methylation patterns may still be useful predictors of later adiposity.},

	abstract = {In human and mouse up to 72\% of all genomic loci show evidence of transcription from both sense and antisense strands. The benefit of the resulting natural antisense transcripts (NATs) remains unclear, largely because of a lack of significant correlation between gene ontology and antisense transcription. Here we suggest that a well defined group of NATs may be identified based on structural characteristics. Specifically, these NATs are processed transcripts that are complementary to the corresponding processed sense transcripts in exonic regions. Recent reports have established that co-expressed sense transcripts/NATs are processed into short RNAs. These so called endo-siRNAs are found in both sense and antisense orientation and were hypothesized to mediate pseudogene silencing. Here we propose that NATs are biologically important sources of endo-siRNAs. We also propose that endo-siRNAs are essential components of a regulatory network to control the mutagenic burden that unfolds on nucleic acid level without direct consequences on protein expression.},

To further the knowledge of gene-regulatory effects of Zn on tissues important for adult and fetal Zn nutrition, we analysed the responses of human intestinal Caco-2 and placental JAR cells to changes in Zn supply. Analysis of oligonucleotide microarrays demonstrated that, despite the analogous roles of the two tissues in nutrient transfer, different genes respond to changes in Zn availability in intestinal cells compared with placental cells. A number of Fe- and Cu-related genes were identified as targets for regulation by Zn, revealing potential mechanisms underlying reported dietary interactions between Zn and other metals. We established that there are fundamental differences in Zn-regulated transcriptional control in Caco-2 compared with JAR cells. We demonstrated that Zn-induced transcriptional activation of the metallothionein 2A promoter occurs over different, and physiologically relevant, concentration ranges in Caco-2 and JAR cells, indicating that these cell lines sense changes in the extracellular Zn concentration over different ranges. Also, we established that mRNA levels of the Zn-responsive metal response element binding transcription factor (MTF)-1, and its homologue MTF-2, are regulated by Zn in Caco-2 but not JAR cells, which may in part underlie differential gene responses to Zn in intestinal and placental cells. The present study identified a number of novel molecular targets that may underlie symptoms associated with deficient or excessive Zn supply and highlighted the necessity of taking account of cell- and tissue-specific processes when investigating Zn-regulated gene expression in mammals.},

We now report that ZNF658 acts at the ZTRE. ZNF658 was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry of a band excised after electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a ZTRE probe. The protein contains a KRAB domain and 21 zinc fingers. It has similarity with ZAP1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which regulates the response to zinc restriction, including a conserved DNA binding region we show to be functional also in ZNF658. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted to ZNF658 abrogated the zinc-induced, ZTRE-dependent reduction in SLC30A5 (ZnT5 gene), SLC30A10 (ZnT10 gene), and CBWD transcripts in human Caco-2 cells and the ability of zinc to repress reporter gene expression from corresponding promoter-reporter constructs. Microarray analysis of the effect of reducing ZNF658 expression by siRNA uncovered a large decrease in rRNA. We find that ZTREs are clustered within the 45S rRNA precursor. We also saw effects on expression of multiple ribosomal proteins. ZNF658 thus links zinc homeostasis with ribosome biogenesis, the most active transcriptional, and hence zinc-demanding, process in the cell. ZNF658 is thus a novel transcriptional regulator that plays a fundamental role in the orchestrated cellular response to zinc availability.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2164-9-458},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The successful interaction of bacterial pathogens with host tissues requires the sensing of specific chemical and physical cues. The human gut contains a huge number of neurons involved in the secretion and sensing of a class of neuroendocrine hormones called catecholamines. Recently, in Escherichia coli O157:H7, the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline were shown to act synergistically with a bacterial quorum sensing molecule, autoinducer 3 (AI-3), to affect bacterial virulence and motility. We wished to investigate the impact of adrenaline on the biology of Salmonella spp.
RESULTS: We have determined the effect of adrenaline on the transcriptome of the gut pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Addition of adrenaline led to an induction of key metal transport systems within 30 minutes of treatment. The oxidative stress responses employing manganese internalisation were also elicited. Cells lacking the key oxidative stress regulator OxyR showed reduced survival in the presence of adrenaline and complete restoration of growth upon addition of manganese. A significant reduction in the expression of the pmrHFIJKLM antimicrobial peptide resistance operon reduced the ability of Salmonella to survive polymyxin B following addition of adrenaline. Notably, both phenotypes were reversed by the addition of the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol. Our data suggest that the BasSR two component signal transduction system is the likely adrenaline sensor mediating the antimicrobial peptide response.
CONCLUSION: Salmonella are able to sense adrenaline and downregulate the antimicrobial peptide resistance pmr locus through the BasSR two component signalling system. Through iron transport, adrenaline may affect the oxidative stress balance of the cell requiring OxyR for normal growth. Both adrenaline effects can be inhibited by the addition of the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol. Adrenaline sensing may provide an environmental cue for the induction of the Salmonella stress response in anticipation of imminent host-derived oxidative stress. However, adrenaline may also serve in favour of the host defences by lowering antimicrobial peptide resistance and hence documenting for the first time such a function for a hormone.},

A total of 385 (20\%) of the UA159 open reading frames were found to be absent from one or more of the test strains. Absent open reading frames frequently occurred in blocks of adjacent open reading frames and represented regions previously experimentally detected by polymerase chain reaction, predicted genomic islands and insertion sequence elements as well as novel open reading frames.

	abstract = {Most human somatic cells contain no or very low levels of telomerase. The over-expression of the catalytic subunit (hTERT) of human telomerase is a common method to generate cells with a greatly prolonged lifespan. These cells serve as models for cells that are either difficult to cultivate or have a limited lifespan in vitro. In addition, hTERT over-expressing cells are thought to be a useful resource for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. While tumour suppressors and cell cycle checkpoints are maintained for an extended period in most hTERT over-expressing cells we found that there is a gradual change in gene expression over a range of 130 population doublings (PD) for the majority of genes analysed. Seven genes were significantly down-regulated with increasing population doublings (PDs), while only two were up-regulated. One gene, stanniocalcin 2, was highly expressed in parental fibroblasts but completely diminished as a consequence of hTERT transgene expression. These data demonstrate that in hTERT over-expressing cells two different types of expression changes occur: one can be directly associated with hTERT transgene expression itself, while others might occur more gradual and with varying kinetics. These changes should be taken into account when these cells are used as functional models or for regenerative purposes.},

	abstract = {We investigated whether ancestral liver damage leads to heritable reprogramming of hepatic wound healing in male rats. We found that a history of liver damage corresponds with transmission of an epigenetic suppressive adaptation of the fibrogenic component of wound healing to the male F1 and F2 generations. Underlying this adaptation was less generation of liver myofibroblasts, higher hepatic expression of the antifibrogenic factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) and lower expression of the profibrogenic factor transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) compared to rats without this adaptation. Remodeling of DNA methylation and histone acetylation underpinned these alterations in gene expression. Sperm from rats with liver fibrosis were enriched for the histone variant H2A.Z and trimethylation of histone H3 at Lys27 (H3K27me3) at PPAR-γ chromatin. These modifications to the sperm chromatin were transmittable by adaptive serum transfer from fibrotic rats to naive rats and similar modifications were induced in mesenchymal stem cells exposed to conditioned media from cultured rat or human myofibroblasts. Thus, it is probable that a myofibroblast-secreted soluble factor stimulates heritable epigenetic signatures in sperm so that the resulting offspring better adapt to future fibrogenic hepatic insults. Adding possible relevance to humans, we found that people with mild liver fibrosis have hypomethylation of the PPARG promoter compared to others with severe fibrosis.},

Despite their potential importance for understanding antibiotic resistance and pathogenesis, little is known about their basic cell biology or their means of propagation. We have developed a controllable system for generating L-forms in the highly tractable model bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Here, using genome sequencing, we identify a single point mutation that predisposes cells to grow without a wall. We show that propagation of L-forms does not require the normal FtsZ-dependent division machine but occurs by a remarkable extrusion-resolution mechanism.

Many of these datasets are freely available on the Internet. Making optimal use of these data is a significant challenge for bioinformaticians. Various strategies for integrating data have been proposed to address this challenge. One of the most promising approaches is the development of semantically rich integrated datasets. Although well suited to computational manipulation, such integrated datasets are typically too large and complex for easy visualization and interactive exploration.
RESULTS: We have created an integrated dataset for Saccharomyces cerevisiae using the semantic data integration tool Ondex, and have developed a view-based visualization technique that allows for concise graphical representations of the integrated data. The technique was implemented in a plug-in for Cytoscape, called OndexView. We used OndexView to investigate telomere maintenance in S. cerevisiae.
AVAILABILITY: The Ondex yeast dataset and the OndexView plug-in for Cytoscape are accessible at http://bsu.ncl.ac.uk/ondexview.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Biological experiments give insight into networks of processes inside a cell, but are subject to error and uncertainty. However, due to the overlap between the large number of experiments reported in public databases it is possible to assess the chances of individual observations being correct. In order to do so, existing methods rely on high-quality ‘gold standard’ reference networks, but such reference networks are not always available.
Results: We present a novel algorithm for computing the probability of network interactions that operates without gold standard reference data. We show that our algorithm outperforms existing gold standard-based methods. Finally, we apply the new algorithm to a large collection of genetic interaction and protein–protein interaction experiments.

	abstract = {The origin of the eukaryotic genetic apparatus is thought to be central to understanding the evolution of the eukaryotic cell. Disagreement about the source of the relevant genes has spawned competing hypotheses for the origins of the eukaryote nuclear lineage. The iconic rooted 3-domains tree of life shows eukaryotes and archaebacteria as separate groups that share a common ancestor to the exclusion of eubacteria. By contrast, the eocyte hypothesis has eukaryotes originating within the archaebacteria and sharing a common ancestor with a particular group called the Crenarchaeota or eocytes. Here, we have investigated the relative support for each hypothesis from analysis of 53 genes spanning the 3 domains, including essential components of the eukaryotic nucleic acid replication, transcription, and translation apparatus. As an important component of our analysis, we investigated the fit between model and data with respect to composition. Compositional heterogeneity is a pervasive problem for reconstruction of ancient relationships, which, if ignored, can produce an incorrect tree with strong support. To mitigate its effects, we used phylogenetic models that allow for changing nucleotide or amino acid compositions over the tree and data. Our analyses favor a topology that supports the eocyte hypothesis rather than archaebacterial monophyly and the 3-domains tree of life.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Trichomonas vaginalis is the most common non-viral human sexually transmitted pathogen and importantly, contributes to facilitating the spread of HIV. Yet very little is known about its surface and secreted proteins mediating interactions with, and permitting the invasion and colonisation of, the host mucosa. Initial annotations of T. vaginalis genome identified a plethora of candidate extracellular proteins.
RESULTS: Data mining of the T. vaginalis genome identified 911 BspA-like entries (TvBspA) sharing TpLRR-like leucine-rich repeats, which represent the largest gene family encoding potential extracellular proteins for the pathogen. A broad range of microorganisms encoding BspA-like proteins was identified and these are mainly known to live on mucosal surfaces, among these T. vaginalis is endowed with the largest gene family. Over 190 TvBspA proteins with inferred transmembrane domains were characterised by a considerable structural diversity between their TpLRR and other types of repetitive sequences and two subfamilies possessed distinct classic sorting signal motifs for endocytosis. One TvBspA subfamily also shared a glycine-rich protein domain with proteins from Clostridium difficile pathogenic strains and C. difficile phages. Consistent with the hypothesis that TvBspA protein structural diversity implies diverse roles, we demonstrated for several TvBspA genes differential expression at the transcript level in different growth conditions. Identified variants of repetitive segments between several TvBspA paralogues and orthologues from two clinical isolates were also consistent with TpLRR and other repetitive sequences to be functionally important. For one TvBspA protein cell surface expression and antibody responses by both female and male T. vaginalis infected patients were also demonstrated.
CONCLUSIONS: The biased mucosal habitat for microbial species encoding BspA-like proteins, the characterisation of a vast structural diversity for the TvBspA proteins, differential expression of a subset of TvBspA genes and the cellular localisation and immunological data for one TvBspA; all point to the importance of the TvBspA proteins to various aspects of T. vaginalis pathobiology at the host-pathogen interface.},

	abstract = {Natural antisense transcripts (NATs) are important regulators of gene expression. Recently, a link between antisense transcription and the formation of endo-siRNAs has emerged. We investigated the bi-directionally transcribed Na/phosphate cotransporter gene (Slc34a1) under the aspect of endo-siRNA processing. Mouse Slc34a1 produces an antisense transcript that represents an alternative splice product of the Pfn3 gene located downstream of Slc34a1. The antisense transcript is prominently found in testis and in kidney. Co-expression of in vitro synthesized sense/antisense transcripts in Xenopus oocytes indicated processing of the overlapping transcripts into endo-siRNAs in the nucleus. Truncation experiments revealed that an overlap of at least 29 base-pairs is required to induce processing. We detected endo-siRNAs in mouse tissues that co express Slc34a1 sense/antisense transcripts by northern blotting. The orientation of endo-siRNAs was tissue specific in mouse kidney and testis. In kidney where the Na/phosphate cotransporter fulfils its physiological function endo-siRNAs complementary to the NAT were detected, in testis both orientations were found. Considering the wide spread expression of NATs and the gene silencing potential of endo-siRNAs we hypothesized a genome-wide link between antisense transcription and monoallelic expression. Significant correlation between random imprinting and antisense transcription could indeed be established. Our findings suggest a novel, more general role for NATs in gene regulation.},

Here we describe a novel method that uses structural models to reduce a large number of in silico predictions to a high confidence subset that is amenable to experimental validation.
RESULTS: A two-stage evaluation procedure was developed, first, a sequence-based method assessed the conservation of protein interface patches used in the original in silico prediction method, both in terms of position within the primary sequence, and in terms of sequence conservation. When applying the most stringent conditions it was found that 20.5\% of the data set being assessed passed this test. Secondly, a high-throughput structure-based docking evaluation procedure assessed the soundness of three dimensional models produced for the putative interactions. Of the data set being assessed, 8264 interactions or over 70\% could be modelled in this way, and 27\% of these can be considered 'valid' by the applied criteria. In all, 6.9\% of the interactions passed both the tests and can be considered to be a high confidence set of predicted interactions, several of which are described.

CMC includes patients with AIRE gene mutations who have autoimmune polyendocrinopathy candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy (APECED), and patients without known mutations. CMC patients have dysregulated cytokine production, suggesting that defective expression of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) may underlie disease pathogenesis. In 29 patients with CMC (13 with APECED) and controls, we assessed dendritic cell (DC) subsets and monocyte Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression in blood. We generated and stimulated monocyte-derived (mo)DCs with Candida albicans, TLR-2/6 ligand and lipopolysaccharide and assessed PRR mRNA expression by polymerase chain reaction [TLR-1-10, Dectin-1 and -2, spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and caspase recruitment domain (CARD) 9] in immature and mature moDCs. We demonstrate for the first time that CMC patients, with or without APECED, have normal blood levels of plasmocytoid and myeloid DCs and monocyte TLR-2/TLR-6 expression. We showed that in immature moDCs, expression levels of all PRRs involved in anti-Candida responses (TLR-1, -2, -4, -6, Dectin-1, Syk, CARD9) were comparable to controls, implying that defects in PRR expression are not responsible for the increased susceptibility to Candida infections seen in CMC patients. However, as opposed to healthy controls, both groups of CMC patients failed to down-regulate PRR mRNA expression in response to Candida, consistent with defective DC maturation, as we reported recently. Thus, impaired DC maturation and consequent altered regulation of PRR signalling pathways rather than defects in PRR expression may be responsible for inadequate Candida handling in CMC patients.},

The quality of the protein scaffold, by which the binding peptide is constrained and presented, is of crucial importance. SQT (Stefin A Quadruple Mutant—Tracy) is our most recent development in the Stefin A-derived scaffold series. Stefin A naturally uses three surfaces to interact with its targets. SQT tolerates peptide insertions at all three positions. Peptide aptamers in the SQT scaffold can be expressed in bacterial, yeast and human cells, and displayed as a fusion to truncated pIII on phage. Peptides that bind to CDK2 can show improved binding in protein microarrays when presented by the SQT scaffold. Yeast two-hybrid libraries have been screened for binders to the POZ domain of BCL-6 and to a peptide derived from PBP2’, specific to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Presentation of the Noxa BH3 helix by SQT allows specific interaction with Mcl-1 in human cells. Together, our results show that Stefin A-derived scaffolds, including SQT, can be used for a variety of applications in cellular and molecular biology.

	doi = {10.1002/hep.23549},
	abstract = {Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) due to flucloxacillin is a rare but serious complication of treatment. There is some evidence that flucloxacillin is a human pregnane X receptor (PXR) agonist. This study was designed to investigate the relevance of PXR to flucloxacillin toxicity and to identify genes changing in expression in response to flucloxacillin. Changes in gene expression in human hepatocytes after treatment with 500 microM flucloxacillin for 72 hours were examined by expression microarray analysis. The ability of flucloxacillin to act as a PXR agonist was investigated with reporter gene experiments. Flucloxacillin DILI cases (n = 51), drug-exposed controls without toxicity (n = 64), and community controls (n = 90) were genotyped for three common PXR polymorphisms. Luciferase reporter assays were used to assess the significance of a promoter region PXR polymorphism. Seventy-two probe sets representing 50 different genes showed significant changes in expression of 1.2-fold or higher. Most genes showing changes greater than 3-fold were known to be rifampicin-responsive, and this suggested a PXR-dependent mode of regulation. Using a luciferase-everted repeat separated by 6 base pairs element construct, we confirmed that flucloxacillin was a PXR agonist. We found a difference in the distribution of a PXR polymorphism (rs3814055; C-25385T) between flucloxacillin DILI cases and controls with the CC genotype associated with an increased risk of disease (odds ratio = 3.37, 95\% confidence interval = 1.55-7.30, P = 0.0023). Reporter gene experiments showed lower promoter activity for the C allele than the T allele.
CONCLUSION: Flucloxacillin is a PXR agonist at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, and a functionally significant upstream PXR polymorphism is a risk factor for flucloxacillin-induced DILI.},

To establish its utility in toxicity and genotoxicity screening, cytochrome P450 (CYP) induction, susceptibility to toxins, and transporter gene expression were examined. Conversion to B-13/H cells resulted in expression of male-specific CYP2C11 and sensitivity to methapyrilene. B-13/H cells constitutively expressed CYP1A, induced expression in response to an aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist, and activated benzo[α]pyrene to a DNA-damaging species. Functional CYP1A2 was not expressed due to deletions in the Cyp1a2 gene. A B-13 cell line stably expressing the human CYP1A2 was therefore engineered (B-13−TR/h1A2) and the derived B-13/H cells expressed metabolically functional CYP1A2. Treatment with the cooked food mutagen 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo(4,5-b)pyridine resulted in a dose-dependent increase in DNA damage. B-13/H cells expressed constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and induced CYP2B1 mRNA levels in response to classical CAR activators. However, translation to functional CYP2B1 protein was low and increased minimally by CAR activator treatment. B-13/H cells expressed high levels of pregnane X-receptor (PXR) and induced CYP3A1 in response to classical PXR activators. CYP3A genes were inducible, functional, and activated aflatoxin B1 to a DNA-damaging species. All 23 major hepatic transporters were induced when B-13 cells were converted to B-13/H cells, although in many cases, levels remained below those present in adult rat liver. However, bile salt export pump, Abcb1b, multidrug resistance-associated protein, and breast cancer resistance protein transporters were functional in B-13/H cells. These data demonstrate that the B-13 cell generates hepatocyte-like cells with functional drug metabolism and transporter activities, which can alone—or in a humanized form—be used to screen for hepatotoxic and genotoxic endpoints in vitro.},

Peptide aptamers have been shown to be valuable for use as a component of novel, direct detection methods.

These properties facilitate their use as the detector components of biosensor devices. However, the identification of suitable aptamer targets for particular groups of organisms is challenging. We present a semi-automated processing pipeline for the identification of candidate aptamer targets from whole bacterial genome sequences. The pipeline can be configured to search for protein sequence fragments that uniquely identify a set of strains of interest. The system is also capable of identifying additional organisms that may be of interest due to their possession of protein fragments in common with the initial set. Through the use of Cloud computing technology and distributed databases, our system is capable of scaling with the rapidly growing genome repositories, and consequently of keeping the resulting data sets up-to-date. The system described is also more generically applicable to the discovery of specific targets for other diagnostic approaches such as DNA probes, PCR primers and antibodies.},

Microarray analysis of the total Caco-2 cell transcriptome was carried out using Illumina HumanHT-12v3 beadchips and the data were validated by real-time PCR. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis showed that the major canonical pathways affected by GPX4 knockdown were oxidative phosphorylation, ubiquinone biosynthesis, and mitochondrial dysfunction and the top two toxicological lists were mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Western blotting and real-time PCR confirmed that knockdown affected target genes encoding components of respiratory complexes I, IV, and V as well as the protein apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). GPX4 knockdown increased levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and oxidized lipid and decreased mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate levels and mitochondrial membrane potential. Time-course experiments showed that changes in AIF expression preceded those in the respiratory complexes. We conclude that in Caco-2 gut epithelial cells GPx4, through effects on AIF, plays a major role in maintaining the oxidative phosphorylation system and protecting mitochondria from oxidative damage.},

	abstract = {Background Mitochondrial disease is a clinically heterogeneous debilitating condition with a minimum birth prevalence of 9.2 per 100,000, and is associated with a reduced life expectancy. The variable clinical phenotype has previously hindered systematic studies making natural history studies largely anecdotal. There is currently no evidence–based treatment for mitochondrial disease.
Objectives To develop a cohort of 1000 people from across the UK with biochemically, and/or genetically, confirmed mitochondrial disease to facilitate large–scale interventional trials of drugs and novel treatments, and to assess prevention strategies. The cohort will also allow definitive studies on the transmission of mtDNA mutations, and provide longitudinal data on the natural history of the disease.
Design \& Methods Following consultation with the clinical research leads, the Bioinformatics Department at Newcastle University designed and accommodated a secure database on a stand–alone dedicated server. The database is backed–up daily to a second identical, but independent server. A data custodian was appointed to oversee the maintenance, security and access to stored patient information. Research associates were employed in Newcastle and London, along with administrative support, to identify and recruit patients to the cohort study. NIHR portfolio adoption facilitated recruitment through local principal investigators at an additional 16 sites across the UK. The British Neurology Surveillance Unit and British Paediatric Neurology Surveillance Unit have been utilised to identify patients not under active follow–up at one of the three centres (Newcastle, London and Oxford) providing the NHS Highly Specialised Service for Rare Mitochondrial Diseases in Adults and Children. Written informed consent is obtained from patients with confirmed mitochondrial disease. Clinical data is recorded retrospectively and prospectively. The Newcastle Mitochondrial Disease Assessment Rating Scale is utilised whenever possible. All patient data is entered anonymously and unique identifiers are used to contact patients suitable for clinical studies.The Mitochondrial Disease Oversight Committee (MDOC), which includes an ethicist and a patient representative, was established to evaluate the scientific merit and appropriateness of applications and govern utilisation of the Cohort.
Results 988 people have been consented to the cohort to date with 120 identified through surveillance units (BNSU/BPNSU); clinical data is available on 935 (95\%). 49\% harbour mtDNA pathogenic mutations, 10\% nDNA mutations, and 41\% have confirmed biochemical defects but no genetic aetiology identified to date. The m.3243A{\textgreater}G mtDNA mutation is the most commonly identified genetic mutation in the cohort (22\%), followed by single mtDNA deletions (12\%), PEO1 (4\%), m.8344A{\textgreater}G (3\%), and common POLG mutations (3\%). At present 8\% are clinically asymptomatic, 57\% exhibit neurological features, 32\% have ophthalmological involvement, 21\% have gastrointestinal disturbances, 19\% have haematological anomalies, 17\% have cardiac involvement, 13\% suffer from endocrine dysfunction. The most common neurological features include: weakness (40\%), ataxia (30\%), migraine (19\%), seizures (13\%), pyramidal/extrapyramidal signs (6\%), encephalopathy (5\%), stroke–like episodes (4\%), myoclonus (3\%). 15 clinical studies have been approved by MDOC, involving over 250 patients with mitochondrial disease. 6 clinical guidelines have been produced and are available for download: www.newcastle–mitochondria.com/service/patient–care–guidelines.
Conclusion For the first time in the UK it is possible to access a large cohort of well–characterised patients with mitochondrial disease. The cohort provides objective data on mitochondrial disease progression, in children and adults, allowing evidence–based guidelines to be developed, and prognostic advice to be provided to patients and families. There is a vast amount of data still to be analysed that will provide systematic evidence and allow the development of disease prevention strategies.},

These intermediate complexes can become cytotoxic protein-DNA adducts and DSB repair at these lesions requires removal of topoisomerase II. To analyse removal of topoisomerase II from genomic DNA we adapted the trapped in agarose DNA immunostaining assay. Recombinant MRE11 from 2 sources removed topoisomerase IIα from genomic DNA in vitro, as did MRE11 immunoprecipitates isolated from A-TLD or K562 cells. Basal topoisomerase II complex levels were very high in A-TLD cells lacking full-length wild type MRE11, suggesting that MRE11 facilitates the processing of topoisomerase complexes that arise as part of normal cellular metabolism. In K562 cells inhibition of MRE11, PARP or replication increased topoisomerase IIα and β complex levels formed in the absence of an anti-topoisomerase II drug.},

	abstract = {There is considerable interest in defining the relationship between epigenetic variation and the risk of common complex diseases. Strategies which assist in the prioritisation of target loci that have the potential to be epigenetically regulated might provide a useful approach in identifying concrete examples of epigenotype–phenotype associations. Focusing on the postulated role of epigenetic factors in the aetiopathogenesis of obesity this report outlines an approach utilising gene expression data and a suite of bioinformatic tools to prioritise a list of target candidate genes for more detailed experimental scrutiny. Gene expression microarrays were performed using peripheral blood RNA from children aged 11–13 years selected from the Newcastle Preterm Birth Growth Study which were grouped by body mass index (BMI). Genes showing ≥ 2.0 fold differential expression between low and high BMI groups were selected for in silico analysis. Several bioinformatic tools were used for each following step; 1) a literature search was carried out to identify whether the differentially expressed genes were associated with adiposity phenotypes. Of those obesity-candidate genes, putative epigenetically regulated promoters were identified by 2) defining the promoter regions, 3) then by selecting promoters with a CpG island (CGI), 4) and then by identifying any transcription factor binding modules covering CpG sites within the CGI. This bioinformatic processing culminated in the identification of a short list of target obesity-candidate genes putatively regulated by DNA methylation which can be taken forward for experimental analysis. The proposed workflow provides a flexible, versatile and low cost methodology for target gene prioritisation that is applicable to multiple species and disease contexts.},

	abstract = {Objective
To define for the first time the transcriptomes of normal and end-stage osteoarthritis (OA) hip cartilage.
Materials and methods
RNA was isolated from cartilage within 2 h of joint replacement surgery. Gene expression was analyzed using Agilent GeneSpring GX 11 following hybridization to Illumina Human HT-12 V3 microarrays. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to validate the expression of six genes identified by microarray as differentially expressed. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) were used to investigate enriched functions or canonical pathways amongst differentially expressed genes respectively.
Results
In total we identified 998 differentially expressed genes (fold change≥±1.5, P-value≤0.01) between neck of femur fracture (NOF) (n=10) and OA hip (n=9) patient cartilage. These differentially expressed genes were enriched within 71 canonical pathways. A comparison between a comparable knee dataset20 only identified 229 genes similarly differentially expressed although remarkably 34 canonical pathways overlapped between experiments.
Conclusions
This study is the first to report a comprehensive gene expression analysis of human hip OA cartilage compared to control (NOF) cartilage at the whole-genome level. Our differential gene expression dataset shows excellent correlation with similar defined studies using comparable tissue but reveals discord between hip and knee OA at the individual gene status but with commonality with regards the molecular pathways involved.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0010692},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The skeletal site-specific influence of multiple genes on bone morphology is recognised, but the question as to how these influences may be exerted at the molecular and cellular level has not been explored.
METHODOLOGY: To address this question, we have compared global gene expression profiles of human trabecular bone from two different skeletal sites that experience vastly different degrees of mechanical loading, namely biopsies from iliac crest and lumbar spinal lamina.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the lumbar spine, compared to the iliac crest, the majority of the differentially expressed genes showed significantly increased levels of expression; 3406 transcripts were up- whilst 838 were down-regulated. Interestingly, all gene transcripts that have been recently demonstrated to be markers of osteocyte, as well as osteoblast and osteoclast-related genes, were markedly up-regulated in the spine. The transcriptome data is consistent with osteocyte numbers being almost identical at the two anatomical sites, but suggesting a relatively low osteocyte functional activity in the iliac crest. Similarly, osteoblast and osteoclast expression data suggested similar numbers of the cells, but presented with higher activity in the spine than iliac crest. This analysis has also led to the identification of expression of a number of transcripts, previously known and novel, which to our knowledge have never earlier been associated with bone growth and remodelling.
CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides molecular evidence explaining anatomical and micro-architectural site-related changes in bone cell function, which is predominantly attributable to alteration in cell transcriptional activity. A number of novel signaling molecules in critical pathways, which have been hitherto not known to be expressed in bone cells of mature vertebrates, were identified.},
