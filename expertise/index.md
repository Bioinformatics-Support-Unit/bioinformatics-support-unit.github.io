The BSU has expertise in the following areas, and software packages:

Next-Generation Sequence Analysis

BWA, Bowtie and other aligners for all NGS platforms and applications
Mira, Velvet and SPAdes for de novo assembly, including HGAP for PacBio data
Tophat, Cufflinks, DESeq and Trinity (among others) for RNA-Seq analysis, including single-cell expression analysis with Monocle
GATK, VarScan and MuTect for variant calling
MACS, SISSRs and other peak callers for ChIP-Seq analysis
Bismark for bisulphite sequencing
Kraken and QIIME for metagenomics sequence classification
Microarray Analysis

Experience with data from all major array platforms (Affymetrix, Illumina, Nimblegen & Agilent)
Varying data types, including expression, methylation (450K), MEDIP-ChIP, and tiling arrays
GeneSpring GX
BioConductor/R
Proteomics Analysis

Bioinformatic screening for potential protein-protein interactions
Analysis of SILAC data using MaxQuant
2D-GE analysis
Further Expertise

Remote homology and domain detection using HMMs
Database design
Custom pipeline creation
Custom software engineering
As well as these analysis services, we also provide training courses and bespoke 1-to-1 training for researchers and industry. We aim to provide annual Next-Generation Sequencing, and Introduction to Bioinformatics Tools courses. We also run a Bioconductor course in conjunction with Colin Gillespie.
