### Scientific Officer, Bioinformatics

Salary: £24,983 - £26,495, with progression to £28,936.

Closing Date: 09 February 2018

Newcastle University has recently made a substantial investment in genomics - being among the first UK Universities to acquire an [Illumina NovaSeq 6000](https://twitter.com/4130chromo/status/923157331600388096). The Bioinformatics Support Unit will be building the software infrastructure to support primary processing of the data produced by this platform.

The Newcastle University Bioinformatics Support Unit is looking to recruit two bioinformaticians to support the establishing and running of a bioinformatics service for a highly scalable high-throughput sequencer.

The successful applicants will have a first degree in a relevant subject, an in-depth understanding of current developments in bioinformatics, and knowledge of a modern scripting language. It is expected that they will have specific experience with high-throughput experimental data, especially sequencing data. A relevant postgraduate degree is desirable.

This post is part of the Bioinformatics Support Unit, and will be physically located at the Institute for Genetic Medicine, alongside the Genomics Core Facility.
