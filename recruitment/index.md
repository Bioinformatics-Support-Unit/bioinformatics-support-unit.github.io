### Experimental Scientific Officer, Northern Institute of Cancer Research

The BSU is seeking to hire a motivated, independent bioinformatician to support active research programmes in the Northern Institute of Cancer Research.

The successful applicant will join a large and successful team of support bioinformaticians who collaborate with researchers from across the Faculty of Medical Sciences, and beyond. 

You will have a relevant first degree or equivalent qualifications and/or experience in a relevant scientific/technical role, together with previous specialist experience in bioinformatics. Experience with bioinformatics skills especially relevant to NICR, (e.g. high throughput sequencing analysis (Exome analysis, RNA-Seq analysis etc), microarray analysis (expression, copy number, SNP, methylation), and multicategory classification methods) would be especially advantageous. A PhD is desirable. 

This post is part of the Bioinformatics Support Unit but physically located for the majority of the time in the Northern Institute of Cancer Research building. 

Tenable for 3 years in the first instance.
